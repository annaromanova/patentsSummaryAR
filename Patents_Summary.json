   "Epitope description 1": "In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding\nfragment is characterized as binding an epitope comprising\namino acid residue 366 of hPCSK9 (SEQ ID NO:755). In a\nmore specific embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding\nfragment binds an epitope comprising one or more of amino\nacid residue at position 147, 366 and 380 of SEQ ID NO:755.\nIn a more specific embodiment, the antibody or antigenbinding\nfragment of an antibody is characterized as binding\nan epitope which does not comprise an amino acid residue at\nposition 215 or 238 of SEQ ID NO:755.\n[001S] In one embodiment, the antibody",
   "Epitope description 2": "In various embodiments, the anti-hPCSK9 antibody\nor antigen-binding fragment of an antibody binds an epitope\nwithin the catalytic domain, which is about 153 to 425 of SEQ\nID NO:755); more specifically, an epitope from about 153 to\nabout 250 or from about 250 to about 425; more specifically,\nthe antibody or antibody fragment of the invention binds an\nepitope within the fragment from about 153 to about 208,\nfrom about 200 to about 260, from about 250 to about 300,\nfrom about 275 to about 325, from about 300 to about 360,\nfrom about 350 to about 400, and/or from about 375 to about\n425.",
   "Epitope description 3": "In various embodiments, the anti-hPCSK9 antibody\nor antigen-binding fragment of an antibody binds an epitope\nwithin the propeptide domain (residues 31 to 152 of SEQ ID\nNO:755); more specifically, an epitope from about residue 31\nto about residue 90 or from about residue 90 to about residue\n152; more specifically, the antibody or antibody fragment of\nthe invention binds an epitope within the fragment from about\nresidue 31 to about residue 60, from about residue 60 to about\nresidue 90, from about residue 85 to about residue 110, from\nabout residue 100 to about residue 130, from about residue\n125 to about residue 150, from about residue 135 to about\nresidue 152, and/or from about residue 140 to about residue\n152.",
   "Epitope description 4": "In some embodiments, the anti-hPCSK9 antibody\nor antigen-binding fragment of an antibody binds an epitope within the C-terminal domain, (residues 426 to 692 of SEQ\nID NO:755); more specifically, an epitope from about residue\n426 to about residue 570 or from about residue 570 to about\nresidue 692; more specifically, the antibody or antibody fragment\nof the invention binds an epitope within the fragment\nfrom about residue 450 to about residue 500, from about\nresidue 500 to about residue 550, from about residue 550 to\nabout residue 600, and/or from about residue 600 to about\nresidue 692.",
   "Epitope description 5": "In specific embodiments,\nthe antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention\nbinds an epitope of hPCSK9 comprising two or more of\namino acid residues at positions 153, 159, 238 and 343.",
   "Epitope description 6": "In some embodiments, the antibody or antigenbinding\nfragment binds an epitope on hPCSK9 comprising\namino acid residue 366 of hPCSK9 (SEQ ID NO:755).",
   "Epitope description 7": "The antibody or antigen-binding fragment of claim 1,\ncharacterized as binding an epitope comprising amino acid\nresidue 238 or 366 of hPCSK9 (SEQ ID NO:755).",
   "Epitope description 8": "The antibody or antigen-binding fragment of claim 1,\nwherein the binding of the antibody or fragment thereof to a\nvariant PCSK9 protein is less than 50% of the binding\nbetween the antibody or fragment thereof and the PCSK9\nprotein of SEQ ID NO:755.",
   "Epitope description 9": "An antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody\nthat specifically binds hPCSK9, characterized as binding an\nepitope comprising amino acid residue 238 or 366 of\nhPCSK9 (SEQ ID NO:755), wherein the binding of the antibody\nor fragment thereof to a variant PCSK9 protein is less\nthan 50% of the binding between the antibody or fragment\nthereof and the PCSK9 protein of SEQ ID NO:755.",
