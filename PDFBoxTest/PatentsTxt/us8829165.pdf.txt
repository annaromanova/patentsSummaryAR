LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al. , 2005).Additionally, various
human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or
decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Ko-
towski et al. , 2006; Zhao et al. , 2006). PCSK9 has been shown
to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed
along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the
LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al. ,
2006). Degradation of the LDLR by PCSK9 has not been
observed and the mechanism through which it lowers extra-
cellular LDLR protein levels is uncertain.
PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the sub-
tilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al. , 2003).
Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that
can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Raw-
lings et al. , 2006). Furin, PCI/PC3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5/
PC6 and PC7/PC8/LPC/SPC7 are classified in subfamily
S8B.Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from
mouse furin and PCI reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic
domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic
domain (Henrlch et al. , 2003; Tangrea et al. , 2002). Based on
the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all
seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Hen-
rich et al. , 2005). SKI-I/SIP and PCSK9 are classified in
subfamily S8A. Sequence comparisons with these proteins
also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic
domains (Sakai et al. , 1998; Seidah et al. , 2003; Seidah et al. ,
1999).In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal
to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest
the presence of a P domain.
Prohormone-proprotein convertases are expressed as
zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The
function of the pro-domain in this process is two-fold. The
pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper
folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al. , 1987).Once

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to antigen binding proteins
that bind to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9
(PCSK9) and methods ofusing and making the antigen bind-
ing proteins.
BACKGROUND OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a
serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low
density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al. ,
2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). In vitro experiments have
shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of
cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al. , 2004; Lagace et al. ,
2006; Maxwell et al. , 2005; Park et al. , 2004). Experiments
with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels
decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et
al. , 2004; Lagace et al. , 2006; Maxwell et al. , 2005; Park et al. ,
2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of

the catalytic domain is folded, autocatalysis occurs between
the pro-domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial
cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the cata-
lytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic
activity (Fu et al. , 2000). When conditions are correct, matu-
ration proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site
within the pro-domain (Anderson et al. , 1997). After this
second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic
domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.
Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between
Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQISIP) (Naureckiene et al. , 2003),
and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells
(Seidah et al. , 2003). A second autocatalytic event at a site
within PCSK9's pro-domain has not been observed. Purified
PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by
non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the
catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not
been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and mea-
surements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable
(Naureckiene et al. , 2003; Seidah et al. , 2003).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN
EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
Antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies and func-
tional binding fragments thereof) that bind to PCSK9 are
disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the antigen binding
proteins bind to PCSK9 and prevent PCSK9 from functioning
in various ways. In some embodiments, the antigen binding
proteins block or reduce the ability of PCSK9 to interact with
other substances. For example, in some embodiments, the
antigen binding protein binds to PCSK9 in a manner that
prevents or reduces the likelihood that PCSK9 will bind to
LDLR. In other embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind
to PCSK9 but do not block PCSK9's ability to interact with
LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins
are human monoclonal antibodies.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of
the present disclosure, altering the interactions between
PCSK9 and LDLR can increase the amount of LDLR avail-
able for binding to LDL, which in turn decreases the amount
of serum LDL in a subject, resulting in a reduction in the
subject's serum cholesterol level. As such, antigen binding
proteins to PCSK9 can be used in various methods and com-
positions for treating subjects with elevated serum cholesterol
levels, at risk of elevated serum cholesterol levels, or which
could benefit from a reduction in their serum cholesterol
levels. Thus, various methods and techniques for lowering,
maintaining, or preventing an increase in serum cholesterol
are also described herein. In some embodiments, the antigen
binding protein allows for binding between PCSK9 and
LDLR, but the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the
adverse activity of PCSK9 on LDLR. In some embodiments,
the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the binding of
PCSK9 to LDLR.
For convenience, the following sections generally outline
the various meanings of the terms used herein. Following this
discussion, general aspects regarding antigen binding pro-
teins are discussed, followed by specific examples demon-
strating the properties of various embodiments of the antigen
binding proteins and how they can be employed.

tion as claimed. In this application, the use of the singular
includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. In this
application, the use of "or" means "and/or" unless stated
otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term "including", as
well as other forms, such as "includes" and "included", is not
limiting. Also, terms such as "element" or "component"
encompass both elements and components comprising one
unit and elements and components that comprise more than
one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise. Also, the use
of the term "portion" can include part ofa moiety or the entire
moiety.
The section headings used herein are for organizational
purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the
subject matter described. All documents, or portions of docu-
ments, cited in this application, including but not limited to
patents, patent applications, articles, books, and treatises, are
hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety
for any purpose. As utilized in accordance with the present
disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated,
shall be understood to have the following meanings:
The term "proprotein convertase subtili sin kexin type 9"or
"PCSK9"refers to a polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO:
I and/or 3 or fragments thereof, as well as related polypep-
tides, which include, but are not limited to, allelic variants,
splice variants, derivative variants, substitution variants, dele-
tion variants, and/or insertion variants including the addition
of an ¹erminal methionine, fusion polypeptides, and inter-
species homologs. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9
polypeptide includes terminal residues, such as, but not lim-
ited to, leader sequence residues, targeting residues, amino
terminal methionine residues, lysine residues, tag residues
and/or fusion protein residues. "PCSK9" has also been
referred to as FH3, NARC I, HCHOLA3, proprotein conver-
tase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and neural apoptosis regulated
convertase 1.The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein conver-
tase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the
secretory subtilase family. The term "PCSK9"denotes both
the proprotein and the product generated following autoca-
talysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed prod-
uct is being referred to (such as for an antigen binding protein
that selectively binds to the cleaved PCSK9), the protein can
be referred to as the "mature, " "cleaved", "processed" or
"active" PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being
referred to, the protein can be referred to as the "inactive",
"pro-form", or "unprocessed" form of PCSK9. The term
PCSK9 as used herein also includes naturally occurring alle-
les, such as the mutations D374Y, S127R and F216L. The
term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorpo-
rating post-translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino
acid sequence, such as PCSK9 sequences that have been
glycosylated, PEGylated, PCSK9 sequences from which its
signal sequence has been cleaved, PCSK9 sequence from
which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic
domain but not separated from the catalytic domain (e.g. ,
FIGS. 1A and 1B).
The term "PCSK9 activity" includes any biological effect
of PCSK9. In certain embodiments, PCSK9 activity includes
the ability of PCSK9 to interact or bind to a substrate or
receptor. In some embodiments, PCSK9 activity is repre-
sented by the ability of PCSK9 to bind to a LDL receptor
(LDLR). In some embodiments, PCSK9 binds to and cata-
lyzes a reaction involving LDLR. In some embodiments,
PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to alter (e.g. ,
reduce) the availability of LDLR. In some embodiments,
PCSK9 activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to increase the
amount of LDL in a subject. In some embodiments, PCSK9
activity includes the ability of PCSK9 to decrease the amount
23
US 8,829,165 B2
24
of LDLR that is available to bind to LDL. In some embodi-
ments, "PCSK9 activity" includes any biological activity
resulting from PCSK9 signaling. Exemplary activities
include, but are not limited to, PCSK9 binding to LDLR,
PCSK9 enzyme activity that cleaves LDLR or other proteins,
PCSK9 binding to proteins other than LDLR that facilitate
PCSK9 action, PCSK9 altering APOB secretion (Sun X-M et
al, "Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apoliprotein B
secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant hyperc-
holesterolemia, Human Molecular Genetics 14: 1161-1169,
2005 and Ouguerram K et al, "Apolipoprotein B100metabo-
lism in autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia related to
mutations in PCSK9, Arterioscler thromb Vase Biol. 24:
1448-1453, 2004), PCSK9's role in liver regeneration and
neuronal cell differentiation (Seidah N G et al, "The secretory
proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase
I (NARC-I): Liver regeneration and neuronal differentia-
tion" PNAS 100:928-933, 2003), and PCSK9s role in hepatic
glucose metabolism (Costet et al. , "Hepatic PCSK9 expres-
sion is regulated by nutritional status via insulin and sterol
regulatory element-binding protein lc" J. Biol. Chem. 281
(10):6211-18,2006).
The term "hypercholesterolemia, "as used herein, refers to
a condition in which cholesterol levels are elevated above a
desired level. In some embodiments, this denotes that serum
cholesterol levels are elevated. In some embodiments, the
desired level takes into account various "risk factors" that are
known to one of skill in the art (and are described or refer-
enced herein).
The term "polynucleotide" or "nucleic acid" includes both
single-stranded and double-stranded nucleotide polymers.
The nucleotides comprising the polynucleotide can be ribo-
nucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of
either type of nucleotide. Said modifications include base
modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives,
ribose modifications such as 2', 3'-dideoxyribose, and inter-
nucleotide linkage modifications such as phosphorothioate,
phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodisele-
noate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate and phos-
phoroamidate.
The term "oligonucleotide" means a polynucleotide com-
prising 200 or fewer nucleotides. In some embodiments, oli-
gonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length. In other embodi-
ments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or
20 to 40 nucleotides in length. Oligonucleotides can be single
stranded or double stranded, e.g. , for use in the construction
of a mutant gene. Oligonucleotides can be sense or antisense
oligonucleotides. An oligonucleotide can include a label,
including a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, a hapten or an
antigenic label, for detection as says. Oligonucleotides can be
used, for example, as PCR primers, cloning primers or
hybridization probes.
An "isolated nucleic acid molecule" means a DNA or RNA
ofgenomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some com-
bination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion
of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is
found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is
not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should
be understood that "a nucleic acid molecule comprising" a
particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact
chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules "comprising"
specified nucleic acid sequences can include, in addition to
the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or
even up to twenty other proteins or portions thereof, or can
include operably linked regulatory sequences that control
expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid
sequences, and/or can include vector sequences.

Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of any single-
stranded polynucleotide sequence discussed herein is the 5'
end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucle-
otide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction
of 5' to 3' addition ofnascent RNA transcripts is referred to as
the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA
strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that
are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as
"upstream sequences;" sequence regions on the DNA strand
having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 3' to
the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "down-
stream sequences. "
The term "control sequence" refers to a polynucleotide
sequence that can affect the expression and processing of
coding sequences to which it is ligated. The nature of such
control sequences can depend upon the host organism. In
particular embodiments, control sequences for prokaryotes
can include a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, and a tran-
scription termination sequence. For example, control
sequences for eukaryotes can include promoters comprising
one or a plurality ofrecognition sites for transcription factors,
transcription enhancer sequences, and transcription termina-
tion sequence. "Control sequences" can include leader
sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.
The term "vector" means any molecule or entity (e.g. ,
nucleic acid, plasmid, bacteriophage or virus) used to transfer
protein coding information into a host cell.
The term "expression vector" or "expression construct"
refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host
cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or
control (in conjunction with the host cell) expression ofone or
more heterologous coding regions operatively linked thereto.
An expression construct can include, but is not limited to,
sequences that affect or control transcription, translation, and,
if introns are present, affect RNA splicing of a coding region
operably linked thereto.
As used herein, "operably linked" means that the compo-
nents to which the term is applied are in a relationship that
allows them to carry out their inherent functions under suit-
able conditions. For example, a control sequence in a vector
that is "operably linked" to a protein coding sequence is
ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding
sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the
transcriptional activity of the control sequences.
The term "host cell" means a cell that has been trans-
formed, or is capable of being transformed, with a nucleic
acid sequence and thereby expresses a gene of interest. The
term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not
the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up
to the original parent cell, so long as the gene of interest is
present.
The term "transfection" means the uptake of foreign or
exogenous DNA by a cell, and a cell has been "transfected"
when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell
membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well
known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, e.g. , Graham et
al. , 1973, Virology 52:456; Sambrook et al. , 2001, Molecular
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, supra; Davis et al. , 1986,
Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, Elsevier; Chu et al. ,
1981,Gene 13:197.Such techniques can be used to introduce
one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.
The term "transformation" refers to a change in a cell's
genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when
it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For
example, a cell is trans formed where it is genetically modified
from its native state by introducing new genetic material via
transfection, transduction, or other techniques. Following
25
US 8,829,165 B2
26
transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA can
recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into
a chromosome of the cell, or can be maintained transiently as
an episomal element without being replicated, or can repli-
cate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have
been "stably transformed" when the transforming DNA is
replicated with the division of the cell.
The terms "polypeptide" or "protein" means a macromol-
ecule having the amino acid sequence ofa native protein, that
is, a protein produced by a naturally-occurring and non-re-
combinant cell; or it is produced by a genetically-engineered
or recombinant cell, and comprise molecules having the
amino acid sequence of the native protein, or molecules hav-
ing deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions ofone or
more amino acids of the native sequence. The term also
includes amino acid polymers in which one or more amino
acids are chemical analogs of a corresponding naturally-oc-
curring amino acid and polymers. The terms "polypeptide"
and "protein" specifically encompass PCSK9 antigen bind-
ing proteins, antibodies, or sequences that have deletions
from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino
acid of antigen-binding protein. The term "polypeptide frag-
ment" refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal
deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal
deletion as compared with the full-length native protein. Such
fragments can also contain modified amino acids as com-
pared with the native protein. In certain embodiments, frag-
ments are about five to 500 amino acids long. For example,
fragments can be at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 110,
150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Useful
polypeptide fragments include immunologically functional
fragments of antibodies, including binding domains. In the
case of a PCSK9-binding antibody, useful fragments include
but are not limited to a CDR region, a variable domain of a
heavy and/or light chain, a portion of an antibody chain or just
its variable region including two CDRs, and the like.
The term "isolated protein" referred means that a subject
protein (I) is free of at least some other proteins with which it
would normally be found, (2) is essentially free of other
proteins from the same source, e.g. , from the same species,
(3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been
separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides,
lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is asso-
ciated in nature, (5) is operably associated (by covalent or
noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is
not associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature.
Typically, an "isolated protein" constitutes at least about 5%,
at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50%
of a given sample. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other
RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can
encode such an isolated protein. Preferably, the isolated pro-
tein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or
other contaminants that are found in its natural environment
that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophy-
lactic, research or other use.
The term "amino acid" includes its normal meaning in the
art.
A "variant" of a polypeptide (e.g. , an antigen binding pro-
tein, or an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence
wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into,
deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence
relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants include
fusion proteins.
The term "identity" refers to a relationship between the
sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or
more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and
comparing the sequences. "Percent identity" means the per-

cent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucle-
otides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on
the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared. For
these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any) are preferably
addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer
program (ke. , an "algorithm" ). Methods that can be used to
calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypep-
tides include those described in Computational Molecular
Biology, (Lesk, A. M. , ed. ), 1988, New York: Oxford Univer-
sity Press; Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects,
(Smith, D. W. , ed.), 1993,New York: Academic Press; Com-
puter Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, (Grlffin, A. M. , and
Grlffin, H. G., eds. ), 1994, New Jersey: Humana Press; von
Heinje, G., 1987, Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology,
New York: Academic Press; Sequence Analysis Primer,
(Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds. ), 1991, New York: M.
Stockton Press; and Carillo et al. , 1988, SIAM J. Applied
Math. 48:1073.
In calculating percent identity, the sequences being com-
pared are typically aligned in a way that gives the largest
match between the sequences. One example of a computer
program that can be used to determine percent identity is the
GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et
al. , 1984,Nucl. Acid Res. 12:387;Genetics Computer Group,
University ofWisconsin, Madison, Wis.).The computer algo-
rithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucle-
otides for which the percent sequence identity is to be deter-
mined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of
their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the "matched
span", as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening pen-
alty (which is calculated as 3x the average diagonal, wherein
the "average diagonal" is the average of the diagonal of the
comparison matrix being used; the "diagonal" is the score or
number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the
particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty
(which is usually 'bio times the gap opening penalty), as well
as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are
used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodi-
ments, a standard comparison matrix (see, Dayhoff et al. ,
1978,Atlas ofProtein Sequence and Structure 5:345-352 for
the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al. , 1992,Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. US A. 89:10915-10919for the BLOSUM 62
comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.
Examples ofparameters that can be employed in determin-
ing percent identity for polypeptides or nucleotide sequences
using the GAP program are the following:
Algorithm: Needleman et al. , 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-
453
Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al. ,

Gap Penalty: 12 (but with no penalty for end gaps)
Gap Length Penalty: 4
Threshold of Similarity: 0
Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid
sequences may result in matching ofonly a short region ofthe
two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very
high sequence identity even though there is no significant
relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accord-
ingly, the selected alignment method (GAP program) can be
adjusted if so desired to result in an alignment that spans at
least 50 or other number of contiguous amino acids of the
target polypeptide.
As used herein, the twenty conventional (e.g. , naturally
occurring) amino acids and their abbreviations follow con-
ventional usage. See Immunology A Synthesis (2nd Edition,
E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds. , Sinauer Associates, Sun-
derland, Mass. (1991)),which is incorporated herein by ref-

erence for any purpose. Stereoisomers (e.g. , D-amino acids)
of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino
acids such as tr.-, tr.-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino
acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids can
also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present
invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include:
4-hydroxyproline, 7-carboxyglutamate, e-N, N, ¹rlmethyll-
ysine, E-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine,
N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine,
O-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino
acids (e.g. , 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation
used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal
direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal
direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.
Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of
single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end; the
left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide
sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5'
to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the
transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand
having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the
5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "upstream
sequences"; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the
same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end ofthe
RNA transcript are referred to as "downstream sequences. "
Conservative amino acid substitutions can encompass non-
naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically
incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by
synthesis inbiological systems. These includepeptidomimet-
ics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moi-
eties.
Naturally occurring residues can be divided into classes
based on common side chain properties:
I) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Be;
2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;
3) acidic: Asp, Glu;
4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;
5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and
6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.
For example, non-conservative substitutions can involve the
exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member
from another class. Such substituted residues can be intro-
duced, for example, into regions ofa human antibody that are
homologous with non-human antibodies, or into the non-
homologous regions of the molecule.
In making changes to the antigen binding protein or the
PCSK9 protein, according to certain embodiments, the
hydropathic index of amino acids can be considered. Each
amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis
of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are:
isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylala-
nine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); ala-
nine (+1.8); glycine (—0.4); threonine (—0.7); serine (—0.8);
tryptophan (—0.9); tyrosine (—1.3); proline (—1.6); histidine
(—3.2); glutamate (—3.5); glutamine (—3.5); aspartate (—3.5);
asparagine (—3.5); lysine (—3.9); and arginine (—4.5).
The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in
conferring interactive biological function on a protein is
understood in the art. Kyte et al. , J. Mol. Biol., 157:105-131
(1982).It is known that certain amino acids can be substituted
for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or
score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making
changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodi-
ments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic
indices are within ~2 is included. In certain embodiments,
those which are within ~1 are included, and in certain
embodiments, those within ~0.5 are included.

The term "derivative" refers to a molecule that includes a
chemical modification other than an insertion, deletion, or
substitution of amino acids (or nucleic acids). In certain
embodiments, derivatives comprise covalent modifications,
including, but not limited to, chemical bonding with poly-
mers, lipids, or other organic or inorganic moieties. In certain
embodiments, a chemically modified antigen binding protein
can have a greater circulating half-li fe than an antigen binding
protein that is not chemically modified. In certain embodi-
ments, a chemically modified antigen binding protein can
have improved targeting capacity for desired cells, tissues,
and/or organs. In some embodiments, a derivative antigen
binding protein is covalently modified to include one or more
water soluble polymer attachments, including, but not limited
to, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypro-
It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like
amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydro-
philicity, particularly where the biologically functional pro-
tein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immu-
nological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain
embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a
protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent
amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antige-
nicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.
The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to
these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0~1);
aspartate (+3.0~1); glutamate (+3.0~1); serine (+03); aspar-
agine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (—0.4);
proline (—0.5~1); alanine (—0.5); histidine (—0.5); cysteine
(—1.0); methionine (—13);valine (—1.5); leucine (—1.8); iso-
leucine (—1.8); tyrosine (—2.3); phenylalanine (—2.5) and
tryptophan (—3.4). In making changes based upon similar
hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitu-
tion of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ~2
is included, in certain embodiments, those which are within
~1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within
~0.5 are included. One can also identify epitopes from pri-
mary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity.
These regions are also referred to as "epitopic core regions. "
Exemplary amino acid substitutions are set forth in Table 1.

pylene glycol. See, e.g. , U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835, 4,496,689,
4,301,144, 4,670,417, 4,791,192 and 4, 179,337. In certain
embodiments, a derivative antigen binding protein comprises
one or more polymer, including, but not limited to,
monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or
other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrroli-
done)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers,
a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxy-
ethylated polyols (e.g. , glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as
well as mixtures of such polymers.
In certain embodiments, a derivative is covalently modified
with polyethylene glycol (PEG) subunits. In certain embodi-
ments, one or more water-soluble polymer is bonded at one or
more specific position, for example at the amino terminus, of
a derivative. In certain embodiments, one or more water-
soluble polymer is randomly attached to one or more side
chains ofa derivative. In certain embodiments, PEG is used to
improve the therapeutic capacity for an antigen binding pro-
tein. In certain embodiments, PEG is used to improve the
therapeutic capacity for a humanized antibody. Certain such
methods are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6, 133,
426, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any pur-
pose.
Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical
industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to
those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide
compound are termed "peptide mimetic s"or "peptidomimet-
ics." Fauchere, J., Adv. Drug Res. , 15:29 (1986); Veber &
Freidinger, TINS, p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. , J. Med.
Chem. , 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by
reference for any purpose. Such compounds are often devel-
oped with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Pep-
tide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically
useful peptides can be used to produce a similar therapeutic or
prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structur-
ally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (ke. , a polypeptide that
has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such
as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages
optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: ~H~NH
CH~S, CH~~H~, CH CH-(cis and trans),
COCH~, ~H(OH)CH~, and CH~SO, by meth-
ods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or
more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino
acid of the same type (e.g. , D-lysine in place of L-Iysine) can
be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable pep-
tides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consen-
sus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence
variation can be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo
and Gierasch, Ann. Rev. Biochem. , 61:387(1992), incorpo-
rated herein by reference for any purpose); for example, by
adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramo-
lecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.
The term "naturally occurring" as used throughout the
specification in connection with biological materials such as
polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, and the like, refers to
materials which are found in nature or a form of the materials
that is found in nature.
An "antigen binding protein" ("ABP") as used herein
means any protein that binds a specified target antigen. In the
instant application, the specified target antigen is the PCSK9
protein or fragment thereof. "Antigen binding protein"
includes but is not limited to antibodies and binding parts
thereof, such as immunologically functional fragments. Pep-
tibodies are another example of antigen binding proteins. The
term "immunologically functional fragment" (or simply
"fragment") of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain (heavy
or light chain) antigen binding protein, as used herein, is a

species of antigen binding protein comprising a portion (re-
gardless ofhow that portion is obtained or synthesized) of an
antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in
a full-length chain but which is still capable of specifically
binding to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active
in that they bind to the target antigen and can compete with
other antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies,
for binding to a given epitope. In some embodiments, the
fragments are neutralizing fragments. In some embodiments,
the fragments can block or reduce the likelihood of the inter-
action between LDLR and PCSK9. In one aspect, such a
fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full-
Iengh light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will
comprise a single heavy chain and/or light chain or portion
thereof. These biologically active fragments can be produced
by recombinant DNA techniques, or can be produced by
enzymatic or chemical cleavage of antigen binding proteins,
including intact antibodies. Immunologically functional
immunoglobulin fragments include, but are not limited to,
Fab, a diabody (heavy chain variable domain on the same
polypeptide as a light chain variable domain, connected via a
short peptide linker that is too short to permit pairing between
the two domains on the same chain), Fab', F(ab')~, Fv, domain
antibodies and single-chain antibodies, and can be derived
from any mammalian source, including but not limited to
human, mouse, rat, camelid or rabbit. It is further contem-
plated that a functional portion ofthe antigen binding proteins
disclosed herein, for example, one or more CDRs, could be
covalently bound to a second protein or to a small molecule to
create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the
body, possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties, or hav-
ing a prolonged serum half-life. As will be appreciated by one
of skill in the art, an antigen binding protein can include
nonprotein components. In some sections of the present dis-
closure, examples of ABPs are described herein in terms of
"number/letter/number" (e.g. , 25A7). In these cases, the
exact name denotes a specific antibody. That is, an ABP
named 25A7 is not necessarily the same as an antibody named
25A7. 1, (unless they are explicitly taught as the same in the
specification, e.g. , 25A7 and 25A7.3).As will be appreciated
by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR is not
an antigen binding protein. In some embodiments, binding
subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding proteins, e.g. ,
EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules through which
PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding proteins. Such
embodiments will be explicitly identified as such.
Certain antigen binding proteins described herein are anti-
bodies or are derived from antibodies. In certain embodi-
ments, the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding pro-
teins is based on antibodies, including, but not limited to,
monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies,
domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred
to herein as "antibody mimetics"), chimeric antibodies,
humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions
(sometimes referred to herein as "antibody conjugates"), and
fragments thereof, respectively. In some embodiments, the
ABP comprises or consists of avimers (tightly binding pep-
tide). These various antigen binding proteins are further
described herein.
An "Fc"region comprises two heavy chain fragments com-
prising the C~l and C~2 domains of an antibody. The two
heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more
disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C~3
domains.
31
US 8,829,165 B2
32
A "Fab fragment" comprises one light chain and the Cul
and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of
a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another
heavy chain molecule.
A "Fab' fragment" comprises one light chain and a portion
of one heavy chain that contains the VH domain and the Cul
domain and also the region between the Cul and Cu2
domains, such that an interchain di sulfid bond can be formed
between the two heavy chains of two Fab' fragments to form
an F(ab')~ molecule.
A "F(ab')~ fragment" contains two light chains and two
heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region
between the Cul and Cu2 domains, such that an interchain
disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A
F(ab')~ fragment thus is composed of two Fab' fragments that
are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy
chains.
The "Fv region" comprises the variable regions from both
the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.
"Single-chain antibodies" are Fv molecules in which the
heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected
by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain, which
forms an antigen binding region. Single chain antibodies are
discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publi-
cation No. WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and
No. 5,260,203, the disclosures of which are incorporated by
reference.
A "domain antibody" is an immunologically functional
immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable
region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain.
In some instances, two or more Vu regions are covalently
joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain anti-
body. The two Vu regions of a bivalent domain antibody can
target the same or different antigens.
A "bivalent antigen binding protein" or "bivalent anti-
body" comprises two antigen binding sites. In some
instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen speci-
ficities. Bivalent antigen binding proteins and bivalent anti-
bodies can be bispecific, see, infra. A bivalent antibody other
than a "multispecific" or "multifunctional" antibody, in cer-
tain embodiments, typically is understood to have each of its
binding sites identical.
A "multispecific antigen binding protein" or "multispecific
antibody" is one that targets more than one antigen or epitope.
A "bispecific, " "dual-specific" or "bifunctional" antigen
binding protein or antibody is a hybrid antigen binding pro-
tein or antibody, respectively, having two different antigen
binding sites. Bispecific antigen binding proteins and anti-
bodies are a species of multispecific antigen binding protein
antibody and can be produced by a variety ofmethods includ-
ing, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking ofFab'
fragments. See, e.g. , Songsivilai and Lachmann, 1990, Clin.
Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321;Kostelny et al. , 1992,J.Immunol.
148:1547-1553.The two binding sites of a bispecific antigen
binding protein or antibody will bind to two different
epitopes, which can reside on the same or different protein
targets.
An antigen binding protein is said to "specifically bind" its
target antigen when the dissociation constant (K~) is (10 M.
The ABP specifically binds antigen with "high affinity" when
the K~ is (5x10 M, and with "very high affinity" when the
K~is ~5x10 ' M. In one embodiment, theABP has a K~of
(10 M. In one embodiment, the off rate is (Ix10 . In other
embodiments, the ABPs will bind to human PCSK9 with a K~
of between about 10 M and 10 ' M, and in yet another
embodiment the ABPs will bind with a K~(5x10 ' . As will

be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodi-
ments, any or all of the antigen binding fragments can spe-
cifically bind to PCSK9.
An antigen binding protein is "selective" when it binds to
one target more tightly than it binds to a second target.
"Antigen binding region" means a protein, or a portion of a
protein, that specifically binds a specified antigen (e.g. , a
paratope). For example, that portion of an antigen binding
protein that contains the amino acid residues that interact with
an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its speci-
ficity and affinity for the antigen is referred to as "antigen
binding region. "An antigen binding region typically includes
one or more "complementary binding regions" ("CDRs").
Certain antigen binding regions also include one or more
"framework" regions. A "CDR" is an amino acid sequence
that contributes to antigen binding specificity and affinity.
"Framework" regions can aid in maintaining the proper con-
formation of the CDRs to promote binding between the anti-
gen binding region and an antigen. Structurally, framework
regions can be located in antibodies between CDRs.
Examples of framework and CDR regions are shown in FIGS.
2A-3D, 3CCC-3JJJ, and 15A-15D. In some embodiments,
the sequences for CDRs for the light chain of antibody 3B6
are as follows: CDRI TLSSGYSSYEVD (SEQ ID NO: 279);
CDR2 VDTGGIVGSKGE (SEQ ID NO: 280); CDR3
GADHGSGTNF VVV (SEQ ID NO: 281), and the FRs are as
follows: FRI QPVLTQPLFASASLGASVTLTC (SEQ ID
NO: 282); FR2 WYQQRPGKGPRFVMR (SEQ ID NO:
283); FR3 GIPDRFSVLGSGLNRYLTIKNIQEEDES-
DYHC (SEQ ID NO: 284); and FR4 FGGGTKLTVL (SEQ
ID NO: 285).
In certain aspects, recombinant antigen binding proteins
that bind PCSK9, for example human PCSK9, are provided.
In this context, a "recombinant antigen binding protein" is a
protein made using recombinant techniques, i.e., through the
expression ofa recombinant nucleic acid as described herein.
Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant
proteins are well known in the art.
The term "antibody" refers to an intact immunoglobulin of
any isotype, or a fragment thereof that can compete with the
intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen, and
includes, for instance, chimeric, humanized, fully human,
and bispecific antibodies. An "antibody" is a species of an
antigen binding protein. An intact antibody will generally
comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-
Iengh light chains, but in some instances can include fewer
chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids
which can comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies can be
derived solely from a single source, or can be "chimeric, "that
is, different portions of the antibody can be derived from two
different antibodies as described further below. The antigen
binding proteins, antibodies, or binding fragments can be
produced in hybridomas, by recombinant DNA techniques,
or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies.
Unless otherwise indicated, the term "antibody" includes, in
addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy
chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants,
fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are
described below. Furthermore, unless explicitly excluded,
antibodies include monoclonal antibodies, bispecific anti-
bodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies
(sometimes referred to herein as "antibody mimetics"), chi-
meric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies,
antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as "antibody
conjugates"), and fragments thereof, respectively. In some
embodiments, the term also encompasses peptibodies.

Naturally occurring antibody structural units typically
comprise a tetramer. Each such tetramer typically is com-
posed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair
having one full-length "light" (in certain embodiments, about
25 kDa) and one full-length "heavy" chain (in certain
embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion
ofeach chain typically includes a variable region ofabout 100
to 110 or more amino acids that typically is responsible for
antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each
chain typically defines a constant region that can be respon-
sible for effector function. Human light chains are typically
classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are
typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon,
and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and
IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but
not limited to, IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has sub-
classes including, but not limited to, IgM and IgM2. IgA is
similarly subdivided into subclasses including, but not lim-
ited to, IgAI and IgA2. Within full-length light and heavy
chains, typically, the variable and constant regions are joined
by a "J"region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the
heavy chain also including a "D" region of about 10 more
amino acids. See, e.g. , Fundamental Immunology, Ch. 7
(Paul, W. , ed. , 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorpo-
rated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The vari-
able regions of each light/heavy chain pair typically form the
antigen binding site.
The variable regions typically exhibit the same general
structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR)
joined by three hyper variable regions, also called comple-
mentarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the
two chains ofeach pair typically are aligned by the framework
regions, which can enable binding to a specific epitope. From
¹erminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable
regions typically comprise the domains FRI, CDRI, FR2,
CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids
to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions
of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and
1991)), or Chothia & Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917
(1987); Chothia et al. , Nature, 342:878-883 (1989).
In certain embodiments, an antibody heavy chain binds to
an antigen in the absence ofan antibody light chain. In certain
embodiments, an antibody light chain binds to an antigen in
the absence of an antibody heavy chain. In certain embodi-
ments, an antibody binding region binds to an antigen in the
absence of an antibody light chain. In certain embodiments,
an antibody binding region binds to an antigen in the absence
of an antibody heavy chain. In certain embodiments, an indi-
vidual variable region specifically binds to an antigen in the
absence of other variable regions.
In certain embodiments, definitive delineation of a CDR
and identification of residues comprising the binding site of
an antibody is accomplished by solving the structure of the
antibody and/or solving the structure of the antibody-ligand
complex. In certain embodiments, that can be accomplished
by any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the
art, such as X-ray crystallography. In certain embodiments,
various methods of analysis can be employed to identify or
approximate the CDR regions. Examples of such methods
include, but are not limited to, the Kabat definition, the
Chothia definition, the AbM definition and the contact defi-
nition.
The Kabat definition is a standard for numbering the resi-
dues in an antibody and is typically used to identify CDR
regions. See, e.g. , Johnson & Wu, Nucleic Acids Res. , 28:
214-8 (2000). The Chothia definition is similar to the Kabat

definition, but the Chothia definition takes into account posi-
tions of certain structural loop regions. See, e.g. , Chothia et
al. , J. Mol. Biol. , 196:901-17 (1986);Chothia et al. , Nature,
342: 877-83 (1989).The AbM definition uses an integrated
suite of computer programs produced by Oxford Molecular
Group that model antibody structure. See, e.g. , Martin et al. ,
Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 86:9268-9272 (1989);"AbM, A
Computer Program for Modeling Variable Regions of Anti-
bodies, "Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd. The AbM defi-
nition models the tertiary structure of an antibody from pri-
mary sequence using a combination of knowledge databases
and ab initio methods, such as those described by Samudrala
et al. , "Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction Using a Com-
bined Hierarchical Approach, " in PROTEINS, Structure,
Function and Genetics Suppl. , 3:194-198(1999).The contact
definition is based on an analysis of the available complex
crystal structures. See, e.g. , MacCallum et al. , J. Mol. Biol. ,
5:732-45 (1996).
By convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are
typically referred to as Hl, H2, and H3 and are numbered
sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the
carboxy terminus. The CDR regions in the light chain are
typically referred to as Ll, L2, and L3 and are numbered
sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the
carboxy terminus.
The term "light chain" includes a full-length light chain
and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region
sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length light
chain includes a variable region domain, Vi, and a constant
region domain, Ci. The variable region domain of the light
chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. Light
chains include kappa chains and lambda chains.
The term "heavy chain" includes a full-length heavy chain
and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region
sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length heavy
chain includes a variable region domain, V~, and three con-
stant region domains, C~l, C~2, and C~3. The V~ domain is
at the amino-terminus ofthe polypeptide, and the C~ domains
are at the carboxyl-terminus, with the C~3 being closest to the
carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide. Heavy chains can be of
any isotype, including IgG (including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 and
IgG4 subtypes), IgA (including IgAI and IgA2 subtypes),
IgM and IgE.
A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artifi-
cial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain
pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies
can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not
limited to, fusion ofhybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments.
See, e.g. , Songsivilai et al. , Clin. Exp. Immunol. , 79:315-321
(1990);Kostelny et al. , J. Immunol. , 148:1547-1553(1992).
Some species ofmammals also produce antibodies having
only a single heavy chain.
Each individual immunoglobulin chain is typically com-
posed of several "immunoglobulin domains, "each consisting
of roughly 90 to 110amino acids and having a characteristic
folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which
antibody polypeptides are composed. In humans, the IgA and
IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains;
the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two
light chains; and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains
and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically
comprises one or more domains that can be responsible for
effector function. The number ofheavy chain constant region
domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains, for
example, contain three C region domains known as C~l, C~2
and C~3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of
35
US 8,829,165 B2
36
these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments of the
present invention, an anti-PCSK9 antibody is of the IgG2 or
IgG4 subtype.
The term "variable region" or "variable domain" refers to a
portion of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody, typi-
cally including approximately the amino-terminal 120 to 130
amino acids in the heavy chain and about 100 to 110 amino
terminal amino acids in the light chain. In certain embodi-
ments, variable regions of different antibodies differ exten-
sively in amino acid sequence even among antibodies of the
same species. The variable region of an antibody typically
determines specificity of a particular antibody for its target
The term "neutralizing antigen binding protein" or "neu-
tralizing antibody" refers to an antigen binding protein or
antibody, respectively, that binds to a ligand and prevents or
reduces the biological effect of that ligand. This can be done,
for example, by directly blocking a binding site on the ligand
or by binding to the ligand and altering the ligand's ability to
bind through indirect means (such as structural or energetic
alterations in the Iigand). In some embodiments, the term can
also denote an antigen binding protein that prevents the pro-
tein to which it is bound from performing a biological func-
tion. In assessing the binding and/or specificity of an antigen
binding protein, e.g. , an antibody or immunologically func-
tional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment can sub stan-
ti ally inhibit binding ofa 1igand to its binding partner when an
excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner
bound to the ligand by at least about 1-20, 20-30%, 30-40%,
40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%,
90-95%, 95-97%, 97-98%, 98-99% or more (as measured in
an in vitro competitive binding assay). In some embodiments,
in the case of PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, such a neu-
tralizing molecule can diminish the ability of PCSK9 to bind
the LDLR. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is
characterized and/or described via a competition assay. In
some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is described in
terms of an ICs0 or ECs0 value. In some embodiments, ABPs
27B2, 13H I, 13B5and 3C4 are non-neutralizing ABPs, 3B6,
9C9 and 31A4 are weak neutralizers, and the remaining ABPs
in Table 2 are strong neutralizers. In some embodiments, the
antibodies or antigen binding proteins neutralize by binding
to PCSK9 and preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDLR (or
reducing the ability of PCSK9 to bind to LDLR). In some
embodiments, the antibodies or ABPs neutralize by binding
to PCSK9, and while still allowing PCSK9 to bind to LDLR,
preventing or reducing the PCSK9 mediated degradation of
LDLR. Thus, in some embodiments, a neutralizing ABP or
antibody can still permit PCSK9/LDLR binding, but will
prevent (or reduce) subsequent PCSK9 involved degradation
of LDLR.
The term "target" refers to a molecule or a portion of a
molecule capable of being bound by an antigen binding pro-
tein. In certain embodiments, a target can have one or more
epitopes. In certain embodiments, a target is an antigen. The
use of "antigen" in the phrase "antigen binding protein" sim-
ply denotes that the protein sequence that comprises the anti-
gen can be bound by an antibody. In this context, it does not
require that the protein be foreign or that it be capable of
inducing an immune response.
The term "compete" when used in the context of antigen
binding proteins (e.g. , neutralizing antigen binding proteins
or neutralizing antibodies) that compete for the same epitope
means competition between antigen binding proteins as
determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein
(e.g. , antibody or immunologically functional fragment
thereof) being tested prevents or inhibits (e.g. , reduces) spe-
cific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g. , a

ligand, or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g. ,
PCSK9 or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competi-
tive binding assays can be used to determine if one antigen
binding protein competes with another, for example: solid
phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase
direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich
competition assay (see, e.g. , Stahli et al. , 1983, Methods in
Enzymology 9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA
(see, e.g. , Kirkland et al. , 1986,J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619)
solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled
sandwich assay (see, e.g. , Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibod-
ies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid
phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see, e.g. , Morel et
al. , 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct
biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g. , Cheung, et al. , 1990, Virology
176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al. ,
1990,Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82).Typically, such an assay
involves the use ofpurified antigen bound to a solid surface or
cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen bind-
ing protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein.
Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the
amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the
presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test
antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding
proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen
binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to
the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins
and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope
sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference
antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Addi-
tional details regarding methods for determining competitive
binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually, when a
competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will
inhibit (e.g. , reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen
binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%,
45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75%
or more. In some instances, binding is inhibited by at least
80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, or 97% or more.
The term "antigen" refers to a molecule or a portion of a
molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent,
such as an antigen binding protein (including, e.g. , an anti-
body or immunological functional fragment thereof). In some
embodiments, the antigen is capable of being used in an
animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that anti-
gen. An antigen can possess one or more epitopes that are
capable of interacting with different antigen binding proteins,
e.g. , antibodies.
The term "epitope" includes any determinant capable
being bound by an antigen binding protein, such as an anti-
body or to a T-cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an
antigen that is bound by an antigen binding protein that tar-
gets that antigen, and when the antigen is a protein, includes
specific amino acids that directly contact the antigen binding
protein. Most often, epitopes reside on proteins, but in some
instances can reside on other kinds of molecules, such as
nucleic acids. Epitope determinants can include chemically
active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids,
sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can
have specific three dimensional structural characteristics,
and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antibodies
specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially rec-
ognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture
of proteins and/or macromolecules.
As used herein, "substantially pure" means that the
described species of molecule is the predominant species
present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any
other individual species in the same mixture. In certain
37
US 8,829,165 B2
38
embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a composition
wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar
basis) of all macromolecular species present. In other
embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise
at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular
species present in the composition. In other embodiments, the
object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein
contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition
by conventional detection methods and thus the composition
consists of a single detectable macromolecular species.
The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical com-
pound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological mac-
romolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.
As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to
incorporation ofa detectable marker, e.g. , by incorporation of
a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of
biotin moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g. ,
streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic
activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric meth-
ods). In certain embodiments, the label or marker can also be
therapeutic. Various methods of labeling polypeptides and
glycoproteins are known in the art and can be used. Examples
of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the
following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g. , H,
' C, '
N,
S, Y, Tc, '"In, ' I, ' 'I),
fluorescent
label (e.g. , FITC,
rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g. ,
horseradish peroxidase, JI-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline
phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biotinyl groups, predeter-
mined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary
reporter (e.g. , leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for
secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags).
In certain embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of
various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.
The term "biological sample", as used herein, includes, but
is not limited to, any quantity of a substance from a living
thing or formerly living thing. Such living things include, but
are not limited to, humans, mice, monkeys, rats, rabbits, and
other animals. Such substances include, but are not limited to,
blood, serum, urine, cells, organs, tissues, bone, bone mar-
row, lymph nodes, and skin.
The term "pharmaceutical agent composition" (or agent or
drug) as used herein refers to a chemical compound, compo-
sition, agent or drug capable of inducing a desired therapeutic
effect when properly administered to a patient. It does not
necessarily require more than one type of ingredient.
The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the
amount of a PCSK9 antigen binding protein determined to
produce a therapeutic response in a mammal. Such therapeu-
tically effective amounts are readily ascertained by one of
ordinary skill in the art.
The term "modulator, "as used herein, is a compound that
changes or alters the activity or function of a molecule. For
example, a modulator can cause an increase or decrease in the
magnitude of a certain activity or function of a molecule
compared to the magnitude of the activity or function
observed in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodi-
ments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the mag-
nitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule.
Certain exemplary activities and functions of a molecule
include, but are not limited to, binding affinity, enzymatic
activity, and signal transduction. Certain exemplary inhibi-
tors include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, anti-
bodies, peptibodies, carbohydrates or small organic mol-
ecules. Peptibodies are described in, e.g. , U.S.Pat. No. 6,660,
843 (corresponding to PCT Application No. WO 01/83525).
The terms "patient" and "subject" are used interchange-
ably and include human and non-human animal subjects as

well as those with formally diagnosed disorders, those with-
out formally recognized disorders, those receiving medical
attention, those at risk of developing the disorders, etc.
The term "treat" and "treatment" includes therapeutic
treatments, prophylactic treatments, and applications in
which one reduces the risk that a subject will develop a
disorder or other risk factor. Treatment does not require the
complete curing ofa disorder and encompasses embodiments
in which one reduces symptoms or underlying risk factors.
The term "prevent" does not require the 100% elimination
of the possibility of an event. Rather, it denotes that the
likelihood of the occurrence of the event has been reduced in
the presence of the compound or method.
Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA,
oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transforma-
tion (e.g. , electroporation, Iipofection). Enzymatic reactions
and purification techniques can be performed according to
manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished
in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and
procedures can be generally performed according to conven-
tional methods well known in the art and as described in
various general and more specific references that are cited and
discussed throughout the present specification. See, e.g. ,
Sambrook et al. , Molecular Cloningt 3 Laboratory Manual
(2d ed. , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring
Harbor, N.Y. (1989)),which is incorporated herein by refer-
ence for any purpose. Unless specific definitions are pro-
vided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the
laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemis-
try, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharma-
ceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and
commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used
for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical
preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of
patients.
Antigen Binding Proteins to PCSK9
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a
serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low
density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al. ,
2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). PCSK9 is a prohormone-pro-
protein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine pro-
teases (Seidah et al. , 2003). An exemplary human PCSK9
amino acid sequence is presented as SEQ ID NOs: I and 3. in
FIG. 1A (depicting the "pro" domain of the protein as under-
lined) and FIG. 1B (depicting the signal sequence in bold and
the pro domain underlined). An exemplary human PCSK9
coding sequence is presented as SEQ ID NO: 2 (FIG. 1B).As
described herein, PCSK9 proteins can also include fragments
of the full length PCSK9 protein. The structure of the PCSK9
protein has recently been solved by two groups (Cunningham
et al. , Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2007, and
Piper et al. , Structure, 15:1-8, 2007), the entireties of both of
which are herein incorporated by reference. PCSK9 includes
a signal sequence, a ¹erminal prodomain, a subtilisin-like
catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain.
Antigen binding proteins (ABPs) that bind PCSK9, includ-
ing human PCSK9, are provided herein. In some embodi-
ments, the antigen binding proteins provided are polypeptides
which comprise one or more complementary determining
regions (CDRs), as described herein. In some antigen binding
proteins, the CDRs are embedded into a "framework" region,
which orients the CDR(s) such that the proper antigen bind-
ing properties of the CDR(s) is achieved. In some embodi-
ments, antigen binding proteins provided herein can interfere
with, block, reduce or modulate the interaction between
PCSK9 and LDLR. Such antigen binding proteins are
denoted as "neutralizing. " In some embodiments, binding
39
US 8,829,165 B2
40
between PCSK9 and LDLR can still occur, even though the
antigen binding protein is neutralizing and bound to PCSK9.
For example, in some embodiments, the ABP prevents or
reduces the adverse influence of PCSK9 on LDLR without
blocking the LDLR binding site on PCSK9. Thus, in some
embodiments, the ABP modulates or alters PCSK9's ability
to result in the degradation of LDLR, without having to pre-
vent the binding interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR.
Such ABPs can be specifically described as "non-competi-
tively neutralizing" ABPs. In some embodiments, the neutral-
izing ABP binds to PCSK9 in a location and/or manner that
prevents PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. Such ABPs can be
specifically described as "competitively neutralizing" ABPs.
Both of the above neutralizers can result in a greater amount
offree LDLRbeingpresentina subject, whichresults inmore
LDLR binding to LDL (thereby reducing the amount ofLDL
in the subj ect). In turn, this results in a reduction in the amount
of serum cholesterol present in a subject.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins pro-
vided herein are capable of inhibiting PCSK9-mediated
activity (including binding). In some embodiments, antigen
binding proteins binding to these epitopes inhibit, inter alia,
interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR and other physi-
ological effects mediated by PCSK9. In some embodiments,
the antigen binding proteins are human, such as fully human
antibodies to PCSK9.
In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic
domain of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to
the mature form of PCSK9. In some embodiments the ABP
binds in the prodomain ofPCSK9. In some embodiments, the
ABP selectively binds to the mature form ofPCSK9. In some
embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain in a
manner such that PCSK9 cannot bind or bind as efficiently to
LDLR. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein
does not bind to the c-terminus of the catalytic domain. In
some embodiments, the antigen binding protein does not bind
to the n-terminus of the catalytic domain. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP does not bind to the n- or c-terminus of the
PCSK9 protein. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to any
one of the epitopes bound by the antibodies discussed herein.
In some embodiments, this can be determined by competition
assays between the antibodies disclosed herein and other
antibodies. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to an
epitope bound by one of the antibodies described in Table 2.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to a
specific conformational state of PCSK9 so as to prevent
PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR. In some embodiments,
the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP binds to the V domain ofPCSK9 and prevents
(or reduces) PCSK9 from binding to LDLR. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9, and while
it does not prevent (or reduce) the binding of PCSK9 to
LDLR, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse activities
mediated through PCSK9 on LDLR.
The antigen binding proteins that are disclosed herein have
a variety ofutilities. Some of the antigen binding proteins, for
instance, are useful in specific binding assays, affinity purifi-
cation of PCSK9, in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands
and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of
PCSK9 activity. Some of the antigen binding proteins are
useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, or inhibit-
ing PCSK9-mediated activities.
The antigen binding proteins can be used in a variety of
therapeutic applications, as explained herein. For example, in
some embodiments the PCSK9 antigen binding proteins are
useful for treating conditions associated with PCSK9, such as
cholesterol related disorders (or "serum cholesterol related

disorders") such as hypercholesterolemia, as further
described herein. Other uses for the antigen binding proteins
include, for example, diagnosis of PCSK9-associated dis-
eases or conditions and screening assays to determine the
presence or absence of PCSK9. Some of the antigen binding
proteins described herein are useful in treating consequences,
symptoms, and/or the pathology associated with PCSK9
activity.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins that are
provided comprise one or more CDRs (e.g. , I, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
CDRs). In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein
comprises (a) a polypeptide structure and (b) one or more
CDRs that are inserted into and/or joined to the polypeptide
structure. The polypeptide structure can take a variety of
different forms. For example, it can be, or comprise, the
framework of a naturally occurring antibody, or fragment or
variant thereof, or can be completely synthetic in nature.
Examples of various polypeptide structures are further
described below.
In certain embodiments, the polypeptide structure of the
antigen binding proteins is an antibody or is derived from an
antibody, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibod-
ies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies,
synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as "anti-
body mimetics"), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibod-
ies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to as "antibody
conjugates"), and portions or fragments ofeach, respectively.
In some instances, the antigen binding protein is an immuno-
logical fragment of an antibody (e.g. , a Fab, a Fab', a F(ab')~,
or a scFv). The various structures are further described and
defined herein.
Certain of the antigen binding proteins as provided herein
specifically and/or selectively bind to human PCSK9. In
some embodiments, the antigen binding protein specifically
and/or selectively binds to human PCSK9 protein having
and/or consisting of residues 153-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3. In
some embodiments the ABP specifically and/or selectively
binds to human PCSK9 having and/or consisting of residues
31-152 of SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments, the ABP
selectively binds to a human PCSK9 protein as depicted in
FIG. 1A (SEQ ID NO: I). In some embodiments, the antigen
binding protein specifically binds to at least a fragment of the
PCSK9 protein and/or a full length PCSK9 protein, with or
without a signal sequence.
In embodiments where the antigen binding protein is used
for therapeutic applications, an antigen binding protein can
inhibit, interfere with or modulate one or more biological
activities of PCSK9. In one embodiment, an antigen binding
protein binds specifically to human PCSK9 and/or substan-
tially inhibits binding of human PCSK9 to LDLR by at least
about 20'zo-40'zo, 40-60'zo, 60-80'zo, 80-85'zo, or more (for
example, by measuring binding in an in vitro competitive
binding assay). Some of the antigen binding proteins that are
provided herein are antibodies. In some embodiments, the
ABP has a K~ of less (binding more tightly) than 10, 10
10, 10 ', 10 ",10 ', 10 ' M. In some embodiments, the
ABP has an IC50 for blocking the binding ofLDLR to PCSK9
(D374Y, high affinity variant) of less than I microM, 1000
nM to 100 nM, 100 nM to 10 nM, 10 nM to I nM, 1000 pM
to 500 pM, 500 pM to 200 pM, less than 200 pM, 200 pM to
150pM, 200 pMto 100pM, 100pMto 10pM, 10pMto I pM.
One example of an IgG2 heavy chain constant domain of
an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the present invention has the
amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 154, FIG.
3KK.

One example of an IgG4 heavy chain constant domain of
an anti-PCSK9 antibody of the present invention has the
amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 155, FIG.
3KK.
One example of a kappa light chain constant domain of an

Variable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally
exhibit the same overall structure, comprising relatively con-
served framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable
regions, more often called "complementarity determining
regions" or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each
heavy chain/light chain pair mentioned above typically are
aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that
binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target protein
(e.g. , PCSK9). From ¹erminal to C-terminal, naturally-
occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typi-
cally conform with the following order of these elements:
FRI, CDRI, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4.A numbering
system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino
acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This
numbering system is defined in Kabat Sequences of Proteins
of Immunological Interest (1987 and 1991, NIH, Bethesda,
Md. ), or Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917;
Chothia et al. , 1989, Nature 342:878-883.
Various heavy chain and light chain variable regions are
provided herein and are depicted in FIGS. 2A-3JJ and 3LL-
3BBB.In some embodiments, each of these variable regions
can be attached to the above heavy and light chain constant
regions to form a complete antibody heavy and light chain,
respectively. Further, each of the so generated heavy and light
chain sequences can be combined to form a complete anti-
body structure.
Specific examples of some of the variable regions of the
light and heavy chains of the antibodies that are provided and
their corresponding amino acid sequences are summarized in

Again, each of the exemplary variable heavy chains listed
in Table 2 can be combined with any of the exemplary vari-
able light chains shown in Table 2 to form an antibody. Table
2 shows exemplary light and heavy chain pairings found in
several of the antibodies disclosed herein. In some instances,
the antibodies include at least one variable heavy chain and
one variable light chain from those listed in Table 2. In other
instances, the antibodies contain two identical light chains
and two identical heavy chains. As an example, an antibody or
antigen binding protein can include a heavy chain and a light
chain, two heavy chains, or two light chains. In some embodi-
ments the antigen binding protein comprises (and/or consists)
of I, 2, and/or 3 heavy and/or light CDRs from at least one of
the sequences listed in Table 2 (CDRs for the sequences are
outlined in FIGS. 2A-3D, and other embodiments in FIGS.
3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D). In some embodiments, all 6
CDRs (CDRI-3 from the light (CDRLI, CDRL2, CDRL3)
and CDRI-3 from the heavy (CDRHI, CDRH2, and
CDRH3)) are part of the ABP. In some embodiments, I, 2, 3,
4, 5, or more CDRs are included in the ABP. In some embodi-
ments, one heavy and one light CDR from the CDRs in the
sequences in Table 2 is included in the ABP (CDRs for the
sequences in table 2 are outlined in FIGS. 2A-3D). In some
embodiments, additional sections (e.g. , as depicted in FIGS.
2A-2D, 3A-3D, and other embodiments in 3CCC-3JJJ and
15A-15D) are also included in the ABP. Examples of CDRs
and FRs for the heavy and light chains noted in Table 2 are
outlined in FIGS. 2A-3D (and other embodiments in FIGS.
3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D). Optional light chain variable
sequences (including CDRI, CDR2, CDR3, FRI, FR2, FR3,
and FR4) can be selected from the following: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12,
13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31,32, 33,
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46. Optional heavy chain
variable sequences (including CDRI, CDR2, CDR3, FRI,
FR2, FR3, and FR4) can be selected from the following: 74,
85, 71,72, 67, 87, 58, 52, 51, 53, 48, 54, 55, 56, 49, 57, 50, 91,
64, 62, 89, 65, 79, 80, 76, 77, 78, 83, 69, 81, and 60. In some
of the entries in FIG. 2A-3D, variations of the sequences or
alternative boundaries of the CDRs and FRs are identified.
These alternatives are identified with a "vl" following the
ABP name. As most of these alternatives are minor in nature,
only sections with differences are displayed in the table. It is
understood that the remaining section of the light or heavy
chain is the same as shown for the base ABP in the other
panels. Thus, for example, 19H9vl in FIG. 2C has the same
FRI, CDRI, and FR2 as 19H9 in FIG. 2A as the only differ-
ence is noted in FIG. 2C. For three of the nucleic acid
sequences (ABPs 26E 10, 30B9,and 31B12),additional alter-
native nucleic acid sequences are provided in the figures. As
will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, no more than one
such sequence need actually be used in the creation of an
43
US 8,829,165 B2
44
antibody or ABP. Indeed, in some embodiments, only one or
neither of the specific heavy or light chain nucleic acids need
be present.
In some embodiments, the ABP is encoded by a nucleic
acid sequence that can encode any of the protein sequences in
Table 2.
In some embodiments, the ABP binds selectively to the
form of PCSK9 that binds to LDLR (e.g. , the autocatalyzed
form of the molecule). In some embodiments, the antigen
binding protein does not bind to the c-terminus of the catay-
lytic domain (e.g. , the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30,
30-40 most amino acids in the c-terminus). In some embodi-
ments, the antigen binding protein does not bind to the n-ter-
minus of the catalytic domain (e.g. , the 5. 5-10, 10-15, 15-20,
20-25, 25-30, 30-40 most amino acids in the n-terminus). In
some embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within
amino acids 1-100 of the mature form of PCSK9. In some
embodiments, the ABP binds to amino acids within (and/or
amino acid sequences consisting of) amino acids 31-100,
100-200, 31-152, 153-692, 200-300, 300-400, 452-683, 400-
500, 500-600, 31-692, 31-449, and/or 600-692. In some
embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain. In some
embodiments, the neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing ABP
binds to the prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds
to both the catalytic and pro domains. In some embodiments,
the ABP binds to the catalytic domain so as to obstruct an area
on the catalytic domain that interacts with the pro domain. In
some embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain at
a location or surface that the pro-domain interacts with as
outlined in Piper et al. (Structure 15:1-8(2007), the entirety of
which is hereby incorporated by reference, including the
structural representations therein). In some embodiments, the
ABP binds to the catalytic domain and restricts the mobility
ofthe prodomain. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to the
catalytic domain without binding to the pro-domain. In some
embodiments, the ABP binds to the catalytic domain, without
binding to the pro-domain, while preventing the pro-domain
from reorienting to allow PCSK9 to bind to LDLR. In some
embodiments, the ABP binds in the same epitope as those
surrounding residues 149-152 of the pro-domain in Piper et
al. In some embodiments, the ABPs bind to the groove (as
outlined in Piper et al.) on the V domain. In some embodi-
ments, the ABPs bind to the histidine-rich patch proximal to
the groove on the V domain. In some embodiments, such
antibodies (that bind to the V domain) are not neutralizing. In
some embodiments, antibodies that bind to the V domain are
neutralizing. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABPs
prevent the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR. In some embodi-
ments, the neturalizing ABPs, while preventing the PCSK9
degradation of LDLR, do not prevent the binding of PCSK9
to LDLR (for example ABP 31A4). In some embodiments,
the ABP binds to or blocks at least one of the histidines
depicted in FIG. 4 of the Piper et al. paper. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP blocks the catalytic triad in PCSK9.
In some embodiments, the antibody binds selectively to
variant PCSK9 proteins, e.g. , D374Y over wild type PCSK9.
In some embodiments, these antibodies bind to the variant at
least twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5,
5-10, 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10,000 fold or more to the
mutant than the wild type (as measured via a K~). In some
embodiments, the antibody selectively inhibits variant
D374Y PCSK9 from interacting with LDLR over wild type
PCSK9's ability to interact with LDLR. In some embodi-
ments, these antibodies block the variant's ability to bind to
LDLR more strongly than the wild type' s ability, e.g. , at least
twice as strongly as the wild type, and preferably 2-5, 5-10,
10-100, 100-1000 fold or more to the mutant than the wild

type (as measured via an IC50). In some embodiments, the
antibody binds to and neutralizes both wild type PCSK9 and
variant forms of PCSK9, such as D374Y at similar levels. In
some embodiments, the antibody binds to PCSK9 to prevent
variants of LDLR from binding to PCSK9. In some embodi-
ments, the variants of LDLR are at least 50% identical to
human LDLR. It is noted that variants of LDLR are known to
those of skill in the art (e.g. , Brown M S et al, "Calcium cages,
acid baths and recycling receptors" Nature 388: 629-630,
1997).In some embodiments, the ABP can raise the level of
effective LDLR in heterozygote familial hypercholester-
olemia (where a loss-of function variant of LDLR is present).
In some embodiments, the ABP binds to (but does not
block) variants of PCSK9 that are at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70,
70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, or greater percent identity to the
form of PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1A and/or FIG. 1B.In some
embodiments, the ABP binds to (but does not block) variants
of PCSK9 that are at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90,
90-95, 95-99, or greater percent identity to the mature form of
PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1A and/or FIG. 1B.In some embodi-
ments, the ABP binds to and prevents variants of PCSK9 that
are at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-99, or
greater percent identity to the form of PCSK9 depicted in
FIG. 1A and/or FIG. 1Bfrom interacting with LDLR. In some
embodiments, the ABP binds to and prevents variants of
PCSK9 that are at least 50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-95,
95-99, or greater percent identity to the mature form of
PCSK9 depicted in FIG. 1B from interacting with LDLR. In
some embodiments, the variant ofPCSK9 is a human variant,
such as variants at position 474, E620G, and/or E670G. In
some embodiments, the amino acid at position 474 is valine
(as in other humans) or threonine (as in cyno and mouse).
Given the cross-reactivity data presented herein, it is believed
that the present antibodies will readily bind to the above
variants.
In some embodiments, the ABP binds to an epitope bound
by one of the antibodies described in Table 2. In some
embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to a specific
conformational state of PCSK9 so as to prevent PCSK9 from
interacting with LDLR.
Humanized Antigen Binding Proteins (e.g. , Antibodies)
As described herein, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9
can comprise a humanized antibody and/or part thereof. An
important practical application of such a strategy is the
"humanization" of the mouse humoral immune system.
In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody is substan-
tially non-immunogenic in humans. In certain embodiments,
a humanized antibody has substantially the same affinity for
a target as an antibody from another species from which the
humanized antibody is derived. See, e.g. , U.S.Pat. No. 5,530,
101, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; U.S.
Pat. No. 5,585,089.
In certain embodiments, amino acids of an antibody vari-
able domain that can be modified without diminishing the
native affinity of the antigen binding domain while reducing
its immunogenicity are identified. See, e.g. , U.S. Pat. Nos.
5,766,886 and 5,869,619.
In certain embodiments, modification of an antibody by
methods known in the art is typically designed to achieve
increased binding affinity for a target and/or to reduce immu-
nogenicity of the antibody in the recipient. In certain embodi-
ments, humanized antibodies are modified to eliminate gly-
cosylation sites in order to increase affinity ofthe antibody for
its cognate antigen. See, e.g. , Co et al. , Mol. Immunol. ,
30:1361-1367(1993). In certain embodiments, techniques
such as "reshaping, " "hyperchimerization, " or "veneering/
resurfacing" are used to produce humanized antibodies. See,
45
US 8,829,165 B2
46
e.g. , Vaswami et al. , Annals ofAllergy, Asthma, & Immunol.
81:105 (1998); Roguska et al. , Prot. Engineer. , 9:895-904
(1996);and U.S.Pat. No. 6,072,035. In certain such embodi-
ments, such techniques typically reduce antibody immuno-
genicity by reducing the number of foreign residues, but do
not prevent anti-idiotypic and anti-allotypic responses fol-
lowing repeated administration of the antibodies. Certain
other methods for reducing immunogenicity are described,
e.g. , in Gilliland et al. , J. Immunol. , 62(6): 3663-71 (1999).
In certain instances, humanizing antibodies results in a loss
of antigen binding capacity. In certain embodiments, human-
ized antibodies are "back mutated. "In certain such embodi-
ments, the humanized antibody is mutated to include one or
more of the amino acid residues found in the donor antibody.
See, e.g. , Saldanha et al. , Mol Immunol 36:709-19(1999).
In certain embodiments the complementarity determining
regions (CDRs) of the light and heavy chain variable regions
of an antibody to PCSK9 can be grafted to framework regions
(FRs) from the same, or another, species. In certain embodi-
ments, the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions
of an antibody to PCSK9 can be grafted to consensus human
FRs. To create consensus human FRs, in certain embodi-
ments, FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain
amino acid sequences are aligned to identify a consensus
amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the FRs of an
antibody to PCSK9 heavy chain or light chain are replaced
with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light chain. In
certain embodiments, rare amino acids in the FRs ofthe heavy
and light chains of an antibody to PCSK9 are not replaced,
while the rest of the FR amino acids are replaced. Rare amino
acids are specific amino acids that are in positions in which
they are not usually found in FRs. In certain embodiments, the
grafted variable regions from an antibody to PCSK9 can be
used with a constant region that is different from the constant
region of an antibody to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, the
grafted variable regions are part ofa single chain Fv antibody.
CDR grafting is described, e.g. , in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,370,
6,054,297, 5,693,762, 5,859,205, 5,693,761, 5,66,,322,
5,88,,899, and 5,300,011, and in Jones et al. , Nature, 321:
522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al. , Nature, 332: 323-327
(1988); Verhoeyen et al. , Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988),
Winter, FEBS Letts. , 430:92-94 (1998), which are hereby
incorporated by reference for any purpose.
Human Antigen Binding Proteins (e.g. , Antibodies)
As described herein, an antigen binding protein that binds
to PCSK9 can comprise a human (Le., fully human) antibody
and/or part thereof. In certain embodiments, nucleotide
sequences encoding, and amino acid sequences comprising,
heavy and light chain immunoglobulin molecules, particu-
larly sequences corresponding to the variable regions are
provided. In certain embodiments, sequences corresponding
to complementarity determining regions (CDR's), specifi-
cally from CDRI through CDR3, are provided. According to
certain embodiments, a hybridoma cell line expressing such
an immunoglobulin molecule is provided. According to cer-
tain embodiments, a hybridoma cell line expressing such a
monoclonal antibody is provided. In certain embodiments a
hybridoma cell line is selected from at least one of the cell
lines described in Table 2, e.g. , 21B12, 16F12 and 31H4. In
certain embodiments, a purified human monoclonal antibody
to human PCSK9 is provided.
One can engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse anti-
body production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in
anticipation that such mice would produce human antibodies
in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig frag-
ments can preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as
the proper regulation of antibody production and expression.

By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversifica-
tion and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to
human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in
these mouse strains can yield high affinity fully human anti-
bodies against any antigen of interest, including human anti-
gens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific
human MAbs with the desired specificity can be produced
and selected. Certain exemplary methods are described in
WO 98/24893, U.S. Pat. No. 5,44, ,077, EP 546073, and EP
546073.
In certain embodiments, one can use constant regions from
species other than human along with the human variable
region(s).
The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase sized human
loci in yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and to introduce
them into the mouse germline provides an approach to eluci-
dating the functional components of very large or crudely
mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human
disease. Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for
substitution ofmouse loci with their human equivalents could
provide insights into the expression and regulation ofhuman
gene products during development, their communication
with other systems, and their involvement in disease induc-
tion and progression.
Human antibodies avoid some of the problems associated
with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or
constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived
proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or
can lead to the generation of an immune response against the
antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of
murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can
be generated through the introduction of functional human
antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that
the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human
antibodies.
Humanized antibodies are those antibodies that, while ini-
tially starting off containing antibody amino acid sequences
that are not human, have had at least some of these nonhuman
antibody amino acid sequences replaced with human anti-
body sequences. This is in contrast with human antibodies, in
which the antibody is encoded (or capable ofbeing encoded)
by genes possessed a human.
Antigen Binding Protein Variants
Other antibodies that are provided are variants ofthe AB Ps
listed above formed by combination or subparts of the vari-
able heavy and variable light chains shown in Table 2 and
comprise variable light and/or variable heavy chains that each
have at least 50%, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%,
90-95%, 95-97%, 97-99%, or above 99% identity to the
amino acid sequences of the sequences in Table 2 (either the
entire sequence or a subpart of the sequence, e g. , one or more
CDR). In some instances, such antibodies include at least one
heavy chain and one light chain, whereas in other instances
the variant forms contain two identical light chains and two
identical heavy chains (or subparts thereo fJ. In some embodi-
ments, the sequence comparison in FIGS. 2A-3D (and 13A-
13Jand other embodiments in 15A-15D) can be used in order
to identify sections of the antibodies that can be modified by
observing those variations that impact binding and those
variations that do not appear to impact binding. For example,
by comparing similar sequences, one can identify those sec-
tions (e.g. , particular amino acids) that can be modified and
how they can be modified while still retaining (or improving)
the functionality of the ABP. In some embodiments, variants
of ABPs include those consensus groups and sequences
depicted in FIGS. 13A, 13C, 13F, 13G, 13H, 13I and/or 13J
and variations are allowed in the positions identified as vari-
47

able in the figures. The CDRs shown in FIGS. 13A, 13C, 13F,
and 13Gwere defined based upon a hybrid combination of the
Chothia method (based on the location of the structural loop
regions, see, e.g. , "Standard conformations for the canonical
structures of immunoglobulins, "Bissan AI-Lazikani, Arthur
M. Lesk and Cyrus Chothia, Journal ofMolecular Bio/a~,
273(4): 927-948, 7 November (1997))and the Kabat method
(based on sequence variability, see, e.g. , Sequences ofPro-

In light of the present disclosure, a skilled artisan will be
able to determine suitable variants of the ABPs as set forth
herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodi-
ments, one skilled in the art can identify suitable areas of the
molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by
targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In
certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions
of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypep-
tides. In certain embodiments, even areas that can be impor-
tant for biological activity or for structure can be subject to
conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the
biological activity or without adversely affecting the
polypeptide structure.
Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-
function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides
that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a
comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid
residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues
which are important for activity or structure in similar pro-
teins. One skilled in the art can opt for chemically similar
amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino
acid residues.
One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimen-
sional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that
structure in similar ABPs. In view of such information, one
skilled in the art can predict the alignment of amino acid
residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional
structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can
choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues
predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such
residues can be involved in important interactions with other
molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art can generate test
variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each
desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened
using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such
variants can be used to gather information about suitable
variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a
particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesir-
ably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a
change can be avoided. In other words, based on information
gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art
can readily determine the amino acids where further substi-
tutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with
other mutations.
A number of scientific publications have been devoted to
the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult J., Curr. Op.
in Biotech. , 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al. , Biochemistry,
49
US 8,829,165 B2

13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al. , Biochemistry, 113(2):
211-222 (1974); Chou et al. , Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas
Mol. Biol., 47:45-148 (1978); Chou et al. , Ann. Rev. Bio-
chem. , 47:251-276 and Chou et al. , Biophys. J., 26:367-384
(1979).Moreover, computer programs are currently available
to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of
predicting secondary structure is based upon homology mod-
eling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have
a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater
than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent
growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided
enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the
potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's
structure. See Holm et al. , Nucl. Acid. Res. , 27(1):244-247
(1999).It has been suggested (Brenner et al. , Curr. Op. Struct.
Biol., 7(3):369-376(1997))that there are a limited number of
folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical
number of structures have been resolved, structural predic-
tion will become dramatically more accurate.
Additional methods of predicting secondary structure
include "threading" (Jones, D., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., 7(3):
377-87 (1997); Sippl et al. , Structure, 4(1):15-19(1996)),
"profile analysis" (Bowie et al. , Science, 253:164-170
(1991);Gribskov et al. , Meth. Enzym. , 183:146-159(1990);
Gribskov et al. , Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.USA, 84(13):4355-4358
(1987)),and "evolutionary linkage" (See Holm, supra (1999),
and Brenner, supra (1997)).
In certain embodiments, antigen binding protein variants
include glycosylation variants wherein the number and/or
type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the
amino acid sequences of a parent polypeptide. In certain
embodiments, protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser
number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native pro-
tein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the
sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid
residue designated as X can be any amino acid residue except
proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this
sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an
N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions
which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing
N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrange-
ment of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more
N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally
occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites
are created. Additional preferred antibody variants include
cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are
deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g. ,
serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cys-
teine variants can be useful when antibodies must be refolded
into a biologically active conformation such as after the iso-
lation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants gener-
ally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and
typically have an even number to minimize interactions
resulting from unpaired cysteines.
According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitu-
tions are those which: (I) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis,
(2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affin-
ity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities,
and/or (4) confer or modify other physiocochemical or func-
tional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain
embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in
certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions)
can be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain
embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the
domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain
embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typi-
cally may not substantially change the structural characteris-

ties of the parent sequence (e.g. , a replacement amino acid
should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent
sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that
characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recog-
nized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are
described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles
(Creighton, Ed. , W.H. Freeman and Company, New York
(1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden & J.
Tooze, eds. , Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991));and
Thornton et al. , Nature, 354:105 (1991), which are each
incorporated herein by reference.
In some embodiments, the variants are variants of the
nucleic acid sequences of the ABPs disclosed herein. One of
skill in the art will appreciate that the above discussion can be
used for identifying, evaluating, and/creating ABP protein
variants and also for nucleic acid sequences that can encode
for those protein variants. Thus, nucleic acid sequences
encoding for those protein variants (as well as nucleic acid
sequences that encode for the ABPs in Table 2, but are differ-
ent from those explicitly disclosed herein) are contemplated.
For example, an ABP variant can have at least 80, 80-85,
85-90, 90-95, 95-97, 97-99 or greater identity to at least one
nucleic acid sequence described in SEQ ID NOs: 152, 153,
92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105,
106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117,
118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129,
130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141,
142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 or at least
one to six (and various combinations thereof) of the CDR(s)
encoded by the nucleic acid sequences in SEQ ID NOs: 152,
153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104,
105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116,
117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128,
129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140,
141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, and 151.
In some embodiments, the antibody (or nucleic acid
sequence encoding it) is a variant if the nucleic acid sequence
that encodes the particular ABP (or the nucleic acid sequence
itself) can selectively hybridize to any of the nucleic acid
sequences that encode the proteins in Table 2 (such as, but not
limited to SEQ ID NO: 152, 153, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99,
100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111,
112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123,
124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147,
148, 149, 150, and 151) under stringent conditions. In one
embodiment, suitable moderately stringent conditions
include prewashing in a solution of 5xSSC; 0.5% SDS, 1.0
mM EDTA (pH 8:0);hybridizing at 50' C., —65' C., 5xSSC,
overnight or, in the event ofcross-species homology, at 45' C.
with 0.5xSSC; followed by washing twice at 65' C. for 20
minutes with each of 2x, 0.5x and 0.2xSSC containing 0.1%
SDS. Such hybridizing DNA sequences are also within the
scope of this invention, as are nucleotide sequences that, due
to code degeneracy, encode an antibody polypeptide that is
encoded by a hybridizing DNA sequence and the amino acid
sequences that are encoded by these nucleic acid sequences.
In some embodiments, variants of CDRs include nucleic acid
sequences and the amino acid sequences encoded by those
sequences, that hybridize to one or more of the CDRs within
the sequences noted above (individual CDRs can readily be
determined in light of FIGS. 2A-3D, and other embodiments
in FIGS. 3CCC-3JJJ and 15A-15D). The phrase "selectively
hybridize" referred to in this context means to detectably and
selectively bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and frag-
ments thereof in accordance with the invention selectively
hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and
51
US 8,829,165 B2
52
wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of
detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High strin-
gency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridiza-
tion conditions as known in the art and discussed herein.
Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the
polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the
invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at
least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing
homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%.Two
amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or
complete identity between their sequences. For example,
85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are iden-
tical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum
matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being
matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of
5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred.
Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or
polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino
acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if
they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard
deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation
data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M.
O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, pp. 101-110
(Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation
(1972)) and Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10.The two
sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if
their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical
when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. The term
"corresponds to" is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide
sequence is homologous (ke. , is identical, not strictly evolu-
tionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucle-
otide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to
a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the
term "complementary to" is used herein to mean that the
complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of
a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the
nucleotide sequence "TATAC" corresponds to a reference
sequence "TATAC" and is complementary to a reference
sequence "GTATA".
Preparation ofAntigen Binding Proteins (e.g. , Antibodies)
In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins (such as
antibodies) are produced by immunization with an antigen
(e.g. , PCSK9). In certain embodiments, antibodies can be
produced by immunization with full-length PCSK9, a soluble
form of PCSK9, the catalytic domain alone, the mature form
ofPCSK9 shown in FIG. 1A, a splice variant form ofPCSK9,
or a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibodies
of the invention can be polyclonal or monoclonal, and/or can
be recombinant antibodies. In certain embodiments, antibod-
ies of the invention are human antibodies prepared, for
example, by immunization of transgenic animals capable of
producing human antibodies (see, for example, PCT Pub-
lished Application No. WO 93/12227).
In certain embodiments, certain strategies can be employed
to manipulate inherent properties of an antibody, such as the
affinity of an antibody for its target. Such strategies include,
but are not limited to, the use of site-specific or random
mutagenesis of the polynucleotide molecule encoding an
antibody to generate an antibody variant. In certain embodi-
ments, such generation is followed by screening for antibody
variants that exhibit the desired change, e.g. increased or
decreased affinity.
In certain embodiments, the amino acid residues targeted
in mutagenic strategies are those in the CDRs. In certain
embodiments, amino acids in the framework regions of the
variable domains are targeted. In certain embodiments, such
framework regions have been shown to contribute to the

target binding properties ofcertain antibodies. See, e.g. , Hud-
son, Curr. Opin. Biotech. , 9:395-402 (1999) and references
therein.
In certain embodiments, smaller and more effectively
screened libraries of antibody variants are produced by
restricting random or site-directed mutagenesis to hyper-mu-
tation sites in the CDRs, which are sites that correspond to
areas prone to mutation during the somatic affinity maturation
process. See, e.g. , Chowdhury & Pastan, Nature Biotech. , 17:
568-572 (1999) and references therein. In certain embodi-
ments, certain types of DNA elements can be used to identify
hyper-mutation sites including, but not limited to, certain
direct and inverted repeats, certain consensus sequences, cer-
tain secondary structures, and certain palindromes. For
example, such DNA elements that can be used to identify
hyper-mutation sites include, but are not limited to, a tetra-
base sequence comprising a purine (A or G), followed by
guainine (G), followed by a pyrimidine (C or T), followed by
either adenosine or thymidine (A or T) (ke. , A/G-G-C/T-A/
T). Another example of a DNA element that can be used to
identify hyper-mutation sites is the serine codon, A-G-C/T.
Preparation of Fully Human ABPs (e.g. , Antibodies)
In certain embodiments, a phage display technique is used
to generate monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments,
such techniques produce fully human monoclonal antibodies.
In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a single
Fab or Fv antibody fragment is expressed on the surface of a
phage particle. See, e.g. , Hoogenboom et al. , J. Mol. Biol. ,
227: 381 (1991);Marks et al. , JMol Biol 222: 581 (1991);
U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793. In certain embodiments, phage are
"screened" to identify those antibody fragments having affin-
ity for target. Thus, certain such processes mimic immune
selection through the display of antibody fragment reper-
toires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and sub-
sequent selection of phage by their binding to target. In cer-
tain such procedures, high affinity functional neutralizing
antibody fragments are isolated. In certain such embodiments
(discussed in more detail below), a complete repertoire of
human antibody genes is created by cloning naturally rear-
ranged human V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes.
See, e.g. , Mullinax et al. , Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 87:
8095-8099 (1990).
According to certain embodiments, antibodies of the
invention are prepared through the utilization of a transgenic
mouse that has a substantial portion of the human antibody
producing genome inserted but that is rendered deficient in
the production ofendogenous, murine antibodies. Such mice,
then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin mol-
ecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of
murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Tech-
nologies utilized for achieving this result are disclosed in the
patents, applications and references disclosed in the specifi-
cation, herein. In certain embodiments, one can employ meth-
ods such as those disclosed in PCT PublishedApplication No.
WO 98/24893 or in Mendez et al. , Nature Genetics, 15:146-
156 (1997), which are hereby incorporated by reference for
any purpose.
Generally, fully human monoclonal ABPs (e.g. , antibod-
ies) specific for PCSK9 can be produced as follows. Trans-
genic mice containing human immunoglobulin genes are
immunized with the antigen of interest, e.g. PCSK9, lym-
phatic cells (such as B-cells) from the mice that express
antibodies are obtained. Such recovered cells are fused with a
myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell
lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected
to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies spe-
cific to the antigen of interest. In certain embodiments, the
53
US 8,829,165 B2
54
production of a hybridoma cell line that produces antibodies
specific to PCSK9 is provided.
In certain embodiments, fully human antibodies are pro-
duced by exposing human splenocytes (B or T cells) to an
antigen in vitro, and then reconstituting the exposed cells in
an immunocompromised mouse, e.g. SCID or nod/SCID.
See, e.g. , Brams et al. , J. Immunol. 160: 2051-2058 (1998);
Carballido et al. , Nat. Med. , 6: 103-106 (2000). In certain
such approaches, engraftment of human fetal tissue into
SCID mice (SCID-hu) results in long-term hematopoiesis
and human T-cell development. See, e.g. , McCune et al. ,
Science, 241:1532-1639(1988); Ifversen et al. , Sem. Immu-
nol. , 8:243-248 (1996).In certain instances, humoral immune
response in such chimeric mice is dependent on co-develop-
ment of human T-cells in the animals. See, e.g. , Martens son
et al. , Immunol. , 83:1271-179(1994).In certain approaches,
human peripheral blood lymphocytes are transplanted into
SCID mice. See, e.g. , Mosier et al. , Nature, 335:256-259
(1988).In certain such embodiments, when such transplanted
cells are treated either with a priming agent, such as Staphy-
lococcal Enterotoxin A (SEA), or with anti-human CD40
monoclonal antibodies, higher levels of B cell production is
detected. See, e.g. , Martensson et al. , Immunol. , 84: 224-230
(1995);Murphy et al. , Blood, 86:1946-1953(1995).
Thus, in certain embodiments, fully human antibodies can
be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host
cells or by expression in hybridoma cells. In other embodi-
ments, antibodies can be produced using the phage display
techniques described herein.
The antibodies described herein were prepared through the
utilization of the XenoMouse technology, as described
herein. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human
immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient
in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and
antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are
disclosed in the patents, applications, and references dis-
closed in the background section herein. In particular, how-
ever, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of
mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. patent
application Ser. No. 08/759, 620, filed Dec. 3, 1996 and Inter-
national Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published
Jun. 11,1998and WO 00/76310, published Dec. 21, 2000, the
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
Through the use of such technology, fully human mono-
clonal antibodies to a variety of antigens have been produced.
Essentially, XenoMouse lines of mice are immunized with
an antigen of interest (e.g. PCSK9), lymphatic cells (such as
B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and
the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell
line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines. These hybri-
doma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybri-
doma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the anti-
gen of interest. Provided herein are methods for the
production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce
antibodies specific to PCSK9 Further, provided herein are
characterization of the antibodies produced by such cell lines,
including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the
heavy and light chains of such antibodies.
The production of the XenoMouse strains of mice is
further discussed and delineated in U.S. patent application

In an alternative approach, others, including GenPharm
International, Inc. , have utilized a "minilocus" approach. In
the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked
through the inclusion ofpieces (individual genes) from the Ig
locus. Thus, one or more V~genes, one ormore Diogenes, one
or more J~genes, a mu constant region, and usually a second
constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are
formed into a construct for insertion into an animal. This
approach is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807 to Surani et

Kirin has also demonstrated the generation of human anti-
bodies from mice in which, through microcell fusion, large
pieces of chromosomes, or entire chromosomes, have been
introduced. See European Patent Application Nos. 773 288
and 843 961,the disclosures ofwhich are hereby incorporated

of cross-breeding of Kirin's Tc mice with Medarex's minilo-
cus (Humab) mice have been generated. These mice possess
the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the
kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al. ,

Human antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods.
Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display
(CAT, Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Sympho-
gen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome dis-
play (CAT), yeast display, and the like.
In some embodiments, the antibodies described herein
possess human IgG4 heavy chains as well as IgG2 heavy
chains. Antibodies can also be of other human isotypes,
including IgG1. The antibodies possessed high affinities,
typically possessing a K~ of from about 10 through about
10 ' M or below, when measured by various techniques.
As will be appreciated, antibodies can be expressed in cell
lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding
particular antibodies can be used to transform a suitable
mammalian host cell. Transformation can be by any known
method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell,
including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a
virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with
the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in
the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,
040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby
incorporated herein by reference). The trans formation proce-
dure used depends upon the host to be trans formed. Methods
for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mamma-
lian cells are well known in the art and include dextran-
mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation,
polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, elec-
troporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in lipo-
somes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.
Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are
well known in the art and include many immortalized cell
lines available from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells,
monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carci-
noma cells (e.g. , Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells,
and a number of other cell lines. Cell lines of particular
preference are selected through determining which cell lines
have high expression levels and produce antibodies with con-
stitutive PCSK9 binding properties.
In certain embodiments, antibodies and/or ABP are pro-
duced by at least one of the following hybridomas: 21B12,
31H4, 16F12, any the other hybridomas listed in Table 2 or
disclosed in the examples. In certain embodiments, antigen
binding proteins bind to PCSK9 with a dissociation constant
(K~) of less than approximately 1 nM, e.g. , 1000 pM to 100
pM, 100pM to 10pM, 10pM to 1 pM, and/or 1 pM to 0.1 pM
or less.
In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise
an immunoglobulin molecule of at least one of the IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, Ig E, IgA, IgD, and IgM isotype. In certain
embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a human
kappa light chain and/or a human heavy chain. In certain
embodiments, the heavy chain is of the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3,
IgG4, IgE, IgA, IgD, or IgM isotype. In certain embodiments,
antigen binding proteins have been cloned for expression in
mammalian cells. In certain embodiments, antigen binding
proteins comprise a constant region other than any of the
constant regions of the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgE, IgA,
IgD, and IgM isotype.
In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise
a human lambda light chain and a human IgG2 heavy chain.
In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a
human lambda light chain and a human IgG4 heavy chain. In
certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise a
human lambda light chain and a human IgG1, IgG3, IgE, IgA,
IgD or IgM heavy chain. In other embodiments, antigen bind-

ing proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and a human
IgG2 heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding
proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and a human
IgG4 heavy chain. In certain embodiments, antigen binding
proteins comprise a human kappa light chain and a human
IgG1, IgG3, IgE, IgA, IgD or IgM heavy chain. In certain
embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise variable
regions of antibodies ligated to a constant region that is nei-
ther the constant region for the IgG2 isotype, nor the constant
region for the IgG4 isotype. In certain embodiments, antigen
binding proteins have been cloned for expression in mamma-
lian cells.
In certain embodiments, conservative modifications to the
heavy and light chains of antibodies from at least one of the
hybridoma lines: 21B12, 31H4 and 16F12 (and correspond-
ing modifications to the encoding nucleotides) will produce
antibodies to PCSK9 having functional and chemical charac-
teristics similar to those of the antibodies from the hybridoma
lines: 21B12,31H4 and 16F12.In contrast, in certain embodi-
ments, substantial modifications in the functional and/or
chemical characteristics of antibodies to PCSK9 can be
accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid
sequence ofthe heavy and light chains that differ significantly
in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecu-
lar backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a
sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobic-
ity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side
chain.
For example, a "conservative amino acid substitution" can
involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a
normative residue such that there is little or no effect on the
polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position.
Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide can also be
substituted with alanine, as has been previously described for
"alanine scanning mutagenesis. "
Desired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or
non-conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the
art at the time such substitutions are desired. In certain
embodiments, amino acid substitutions can be used to iden-
tifyy
important residues ofantibodies to PCSK9, or to increase
or decrease the affinity of the antibodies to PCSK9 as
described herein.
In certain embodiments, antibodies of the present inven-
tion can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell
lines. In certain embodiments, sequences encoding particular
antibodies can be used for trans formation of a suitable mam-
malian host cell. According to certain embodiments, trans for-
mation can be by any known method for introducing poly-
nucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging
the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and
transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by trans-
fection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S.
Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455
(which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference
for any purpose). In certain embodiments, the transformation
procedure used can depend upon the host to be transformed.
Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides
into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include,
but are not limited to, dextran-mediated trans fection, calcium
phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection,
protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the poly-
nucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the
DNA into nuclei.
Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are
well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, many
immortalized cell lines available from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chi-

nese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster
kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g. , Hep G2), and a number
of other cell lines. In certain embodiments, cell lines can be
selected through determining which cell lines have high
expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive
HGF binding properties. Appropriate expression vectors for
mammalian host cells are well known.
In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins comprise
one or more polypeptides. In certain embodiments, any of a
variety of expression vector/host systems can be utilized to
express polynucleotide molecules encoding polypeptides
comprising one or more ABP components or the ABP itself.
Such systems include, but are not limited to, microorganisms,
such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacterioph-
age, plasmid, or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast trans-
formed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems
infected with virus expression vectors (e.g. , baculovirus);
plant cell systems transfected with virus expression vectors
(e.g. , cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV, tobacco mosaic virus,
TMV) or transformed with bacterial expression vectors (e.g. ,
Ti or pBR322 plasmid); or animal cell systems.
In certain embodiments, a polypeptide comprising one or
more ABP components or the ABP itself is recombinantly
expressed in yeast. Certain such embodiments use commer-
cially available expression systems, e.g. , the Pichia Expres-
sion System (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif. ), following the
manufacturer's instructions. In certain embodiments, such a
system relies on the pre-pro-alpha sequence to direct secre-
tion. In certain embodiments, transcription of the insert is
driven by the alcohol oxidase (AOX I)promoter upon induc-
tion by methanol.
In certain embodiments, a secreted polypeptide compris-
ing one or more ABP components or the ABP itself is purified
from yeast growth medium. In certain embodiments, the
methods used to purify a polypeptide from yeast growth
medium is the same as those used to purify the polypeptide
from bacterial and mammalian cell supernatants.
In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a
polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the
ABP itself is cloned into a baculovirus expression vector,
such as pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif. ). In certain
embodiments, such a vector can be used according to the
manufacturer' s directions (PharMingen) to infect Spodoptera
frugiperda cells in sF9 protein-free media and to produce
recombinant polypeptide. In certain embodiments, a
polypeptide is purified and concentrated from such media
using a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia).
In certain embodiments, a polypeptide comprising one or
more ABP components or the ABP itself is expressed in an
insect system. Certain insect systems for polypeptide expres-
sion are well known to those of skill in the art. In one such
system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus
(AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes in
Spodoptera frugiperda cells or in Trichoplusia larvae. In
certain embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a
polypeptide can be inserted into a nonessential gene of the
virus, for example, within the polyhedrin gene, and placed
under control of the promoter for that gene. In certain
embodiments, successful insertion ofa nucleic acid molecule
will render the nonessential gene inactive. In certain embodi-
ments, that inactivation results in a detectable characteristic.
For example, inactivation ofthe polyhedrin gene results in the
production of virus lacking coat protein.
In certain embodiments, recombinant viruses can be used
to infect S.frugiperda cells or Trichoplusia larvae. See, e.g. ,

In certain embodiments, polypeptides comprising one or
more ABP components or the ABP itself made in bacterial
cells are produced as insoluble inclusion bodies in the bacte-
ria. In certain embodiments, host cells comprising such inclu-
sion bodies are collected by centrifugation; washed in 0.15 M
NaCI, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, I mM EDTA; and treated with 0.1
mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 15 minutes at
room temperature. In certain embodiments, the lysate is
cleared by sonication, and cell debris is pelleted by centrifu-
gation for 10 minutes at 12,000xg. In certain embodiments,
the polypeptide-containing pellet is resuspended in 50 mM
Tris, pH 8, and 10mM EDTA; layered over 50% glycerol; and
centrifuged for 30 minutes at 6000xg. In certain embodi-
ments, that pellet can be resuspended in standard phosphate
buffered saline solution (PBS) free of Mg and Ca . In
certain embodiments, the polypeptide is further purified by
fractionating the resuspended pellet in a denaturing SDS
polyacrylamide gel (See, e.g. , Sambrook et al. , supra). In
certain embodiments, such a gel can be soaked in 0.4 M KCI
to visualize the protein, which can be excised and electro-
eluted in gel-running buffer lacking SDS. According to cer-
tain embodiments, a Glutathione-S-Trans ferase (GST) fusion
protein is produced in bacteria as a soluble protein. In certain
embodiments, such GST fusion protein is purified using a
GST Purification Module (Pharmacia).
In certain embodiments, it is desirable to "refold" certain
polypeptides, e.g. , polypeptides comprising one or more ABP
components or the ABP itself. In certain embodiments, such
polypeptides are produced using certain recombinant systems
discussed herein. In certain embodiments, polypeptides are
"refolded" and/or oxidized to form desired tertiary structure
and/or to generate di sulfid linkages. In certain embodiments,
such structure and/or linkages are related to certain biological
activity ofa polypeptide. In certain embodiments, refolding is
accomplished using any of a number ofprocedures known in
the art. Exemplary methods include, but are not limited to,
exposing the solubilized polypeptide agent to a pH typically
above 7 in the presence of a chaotropic agent. An exemplary
chaotropic agent is guanidine. In certain embodiments, the
refolding/oxidation solution also contains a reducing agent
and the oxidized form of that reducing agent. In certain
embodiments, the reducing agent and its oxidized form are
present in a ratio that will generate a particular redox potential
that allows disulfide shuffling to occur. In certain embodi-
ments, such shuffling allows the formation of cysteine
bridges. Exemplary redox couples include, but are not limited
to, cysteine/cystamine, glutathione/dithiobisGSH, cupric
chloride, dithiothreitol DTT/dithiane DTT, and 2-mercapto-
ethanol (bME)/dithio-bME. In certain embodiments, a co-
solvent is used to increase the efficiency of refolding. Exem-
plary cosolvents include, but are not limited to, glycerol,
polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, and argi-
nine.
In certain embodiments, one substantially purifies a
polypeptide comprising one or more ABP components or the
ABP itself. Certain protein purification techniques are known
to those of skill in the art. In certain embodiments, protein
purification involves crude fractionation of polypeptide frac-
tionations from non-polypeptide fractions. In certain embodi-
ments, polypeptides are purified using chromatographic and/
or electrophoretic techniques. Exemplary purification
methods include, but are not limited to, precipitation with
ammonium sulphate; precipitation with PEG; immunopre-
cipitation; heat denaturation followed by centrifugation;
chromatography, including, but not limited to, affinity chro-
59
US 8,829,165 B2
60
matography (e.g. , Protein-A-Sepharose), ion exchange chro-
matography, exclusion chromatography, and reverse phase
chromatography; gel filtration; hydroxyapatite chromatogra-
phy; isoelectric focusing; polyacrylamide gel electrophore-
sis; and combinations of such and other techniques. In certain
embodiments, a polypeptide is purified by fast protein liquid
chromatography or by high pressure liquid chromotography
(HPLC). In certain embodiments, purification steps can be
changed or certain steps can be omitted, and still result in a
suitable method for the preparation ofa substantially purified
polypeptide.
In certain embodiments, one quantitates the degree ofpuri-
fication of a polypeptide preparation. Certain methods for
quantifying the degree of purification are known to those of
skill in the art. Certain exemplary methods include, but are not
limited to, determining the specific binding activity of the
preparation and assessing the amount ofa polypeptide within
a preparation by SDS/PAGE analysis. Certain exemplary
methods for assessing the amount of purification of a
polypeptide preparation comprise calculating the binding
activity of a preparation and comparing it to the binding
activity of an initial extract. In certain embodiments, the
results of such a calculation are expressed as "fold purifica-
tion." The units used to represent the amount of binding
activity depend upon the particular assay performed.
In certain embodiments, a polypeptide comprising one or
more ABP components or the ABP itself is partially purified.
In certain embodiments, partial purification can be accom-
plished by using fewer purification steps or by utilizing dif-
ferent forms of the same general purification scheme. For
example, in certain embodiments, cation-exchange column
chromatography performed utilizing an HPLC apparatus will
generally result in a greater "fold purification" than the same
technique utilizing a low-pressure chromatography system.
In certain embodiments, methods resulting in a lower degree
of purification can have advantages in total recovery of
polypeptide, or in maintaining binding activity of a polypep-
tide.
In certain instances, the electrophoretic migration of a
polypeptide can vary, sometimes significantly, with different
conditions of SDS/PAGE. See, e.g. , Capaldi et al. , Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm. , 76: 425 (1977).It will be appreciated
that under different electrophoresis conditions, the apparent
molecular weights of purified or partially purified polypep-
tide can be different.
Exemplary Epitopes
Epitopes to which anti-PCSK9 antibodies bind are pro-
vided. In some embodiments, epitopes that are bound by the
presently disclosed antibodies are particularly useful. In
some embodiments, antigen binding proteins that bind to any
of the epitopes that are bound by the antibodies described
herein are useful. In some embodiments, the epitopes bound
by any ofthe antibodies listed in Table 2 and FIGS. 2 and 3 are
especially useful. In some embodiments, the epitope is on the
catalytic domain PCSK9.
In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized
to prevent (e.g. , reduce) binding of an anti-PCSK9 antibody
or antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In certain embodi-
ments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to decrease binding of
an anti-PCSK9 antibody or antigen binding protein to
PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be
utilized to substantially inhibit binding of an anti-PCSK9
antibody or antigen binding protein to PCSK9.
In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized
to isolate antibodies or antigen binding proteins that bind to
PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope can be
utilized to generate antibodies or antigen binding proteins

which bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9
epitope or a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be
utilized as an immunogen to generate antibodies or antigen
binding proteins that bind to PCSK9. In certain embodiments,
a PCSK9 epitope can be administered to an animal, and
antibodies that bind to PCSK9 can subsequently be obtained
from the animal. In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 epitope or
a sequence comprising a PCSK9 epitope can be utilized to
interfere with normal PCSK9-mediated activity, such as asso-
ciation of PCSK9 with the LDLR.
In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins disclosed
herein bind specifically to ¹erminal prodomain, a subtili-
sin-like catalytic domain and/or a C-terminal domain. In
some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to the
substrate-binding groove of PCSK-9 (described in Cunning-
ham et al. , incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).
In some embodiments, the domain(s)/region(s) containing
residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody
can be identified by mutating specific residues in PCSK9
(e.g. , a wild-type antigen) and determining whether the anti-
gen binding protein can bind the mutated or variant PCSK9
protein. By making a number of individual mutations, resi-
dues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently
close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect
binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can
be identified. From a knowledge of these amino acids, the
domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen that contain residues in
contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the
antibody can be elucidated. Such a domain can include the
binding epitope of an antigen binding protein. One specific
example of this general approach utilizes an arginine/
glutamic acid scanning protocol (see, e.g. , Nanevicz, T., et al. ,
1995,J. Biol. Chem. , 270:37, 21619-21625 and Zupnick, A. ,
et al. , 2006, J.Biol. Chem. , 281:29,20464-20473). In general,
arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically indi-
vidually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide
because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus
have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen
binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen
where the mutation is introduced. Arginines that exist in the
wild-type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety
of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected
binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect
binding.
Example 39 describes one such arginine/glutamic acid
scanning of PCSK9 for PCSK9 antigen binding proteins pro-
vided herein. A series of mutant PCSK9 antigens were cre-
ated, with each mutant antigen having a single mutation.
Binding of each mutant PCSK9 antigen with various PCSK9
ABPs was measured and compared to the ability of the
selected ABPs to bind wild-type PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 303).
An alteration (for example a reduction or increase) in bind-
ing between an antigen binding protein and a variant PCSK9
as used herein means that there is a change in binding affinity
(e.g. , as measured by known methods such as Biacore testing
or the bead based assay described below in the examples),
EC50, and/or a change (for example a reduction) in the total
binding capacity of the antigen binding protein (for example,
as evidenced by a decrease in Bmax in a plot of antigen
binding protein concentration versus antigen concentration).
A significant alteration in binding indicates that the mutated
residue is directly involved in binding to the antigen binding
protein or is in close proximity to the binding protein when
the binding protein is bound to antigen.
In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding
means that the binding affinity, EC50, and/or capacity
between an antigen binding protein and a mutant PCSK9
61

antigen is reduced by greater than 10%, greater than 20%,
greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, greater
than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than
75%, greater than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90%or
greater than 95% relative to binding between the antigen
binding protein and a wild type PCSK9 (e.g. , shown in SEQ
ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: (303).In certain embodiments,
binding is reduced below detectable limits. In some embodi-
ments, a significant reduction in binding is evidenced when
binding of an antigen binding protein to a variant PCSK9
protein is less than 50% (for example, less than 40%, 35%,
30%, 25%, 20%, 15% or 10%) of the binding observed
between the antigen binding protein and a wild-type PCSK9
protein (for example, the protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or
SEQ ID NO: (303).Such binding measurements can be made
using a variety of binding assays known in the art. A specific
example of one such assay is described in Example 39.
In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins are pro-
vided that exhibit significantly lower binding for a variant
PCSK9 protein in which a residue in a wild-type PCSK9
protein (e.g. , SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303 is substituted
with arginine or glutamic acid. In some embodiments, bind-
ing of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced or
increased for a variant PCSK9 protein having any one or more
(e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 244) of the following
mutations: R207E, D208R, R185E, R439E, E513R, V538R,
E539R, T132R, S351R, A390R, A413R, E582R, D162R,
R164E, E167R, S123R, E129R, A311R, D313R, D337R,
R519E, H521R, and Q554R as compared to a wild-type
PCSK9 protein (e.g. , SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In
the shorthand notation used here, the format is: Wild type
residue: Position in polypeptide: Mutant residue, with the
numbering of the residues as indicated in SEQ ID NO: for
SEQ ID NO: 303.
In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding pro-
tein is significantly reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9
protein having one or more (e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more)
mutations at the following positions: 207, 208, 185, 181,439,
513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123,
129, 311,313, 337, 519, 521, and 554, as shown in SEQ ID
NO: 1 as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g. , SEQ
ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, binding
of an antigen binding protein is reduced or increased for a
mutant PCSK9 protein having one or more (e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
or more) mutations at the following positions: 207, 208, 185,
181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164,
167, 123, 129, 311,313,337, 519, 521, and 554, as shown in
SEQ ID NO: 1 as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein
(e.g. , SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodi-
ments, binding of an antigen binding protein is substantially
reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one
or more (e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) mutations at the following
positions: 207, 208, 185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351,
390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311,313, 337, 519,
521, and 554, within SEQ ID NO: 1 as compared to a wild-
type PCSK9 protein (e.g. , SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303.
In some embodiments, binding of an ABP is significantly
reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one
or more (e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) of the following mutations:
R207E, D208R, R185E, R439E, E513R, V538R, E539R,
T132R, S351R, A390R, A413R, E582R, D162R, R164E,

H521R, and Q554R within SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:
303, as compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g. , SEQ ID
NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303).

or more (e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) of the following mutations:

T132R, S351R, A390R, A413R, and E582R within SEQ ID
NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303, as compared to a wild-type
PCSK9 protein (e.g. , SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303). In
some embodiments, the binding is reduced. In some embodi-
ments, the reduction in binding is observed as a change in
EC50. In some embodiments, the change in EC50 is an
increase in the numerical value of the EC50 (and thus is a
decrease in binding).
In some embodiments, binding of an ABP is significantly
reduced or increased for a mutant PCSK9 protein having one
or more (e.g. , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) of the following mutations:
D162R, R164E, E167R, S123R, E129R, A311R, D313R,
D337R, R519E,H521R, and Q554R within SEQ ID NO: 1, as
compared to a wild-type PCSK9 protein (e.g. , SEQ ID NO: 1
or SEQ ID NO: 303). In some embodiments, the binding is
reduced. In some embodiments, the reduction in binding is
observed as a change in Bmax. In some embodiments, the
shift in Bmax is a reduction of the maximum signal generated
by the ABP. In some embodiments, for an amino acid to be
part of an epitope, the Bmax is reduced by at least 10%, for
example, reductions of at least any of the following amounts:
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 98, 99, or 100 percent can,
in some embodiments, indicate that the residue is part of the
epitope.
Although the variant forms just listed are referenced with
respect to the wild-type sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or
SEQ ID NO: 303, it will be appreciated that in an allelic
variant of PCSK9 the amino acid at the indicated position
could differ. Antigen binding proteins showing significantly
lower binding for such allelic forms of PCSK9 are also con-
templated. Accordingly, in some embodiments, any of the
above embodiments can be compared to an allelic sequence,
rather than purely the wild-type sequence shown in FIG. 1A
In some embodiments, binding of an antigen binding pro-
tein is significantly reduced for a variant PCSK9 protein in
which the residue at a selected position in the wild-type
PCSK9 protein is mutated to any other residue. In some
embodiments, the herein described arginine/glutamic acid
replacements are used for the identified positions. In some
embodiments, alanine is used for the identified positions.
As noted above, residues directly involved in binding or
covered by an antigen binding protein can be identified from
scanning results. These residues can thus provide an indica-
tion of the domains or regions of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or SEQ ID
NO: 303 or SEQ ID NO: 3) that contain the binding region(s)
to which antigen binding proteins bind. As can be seen from
the results summarized in Example 39, in some embodiments
an antigen binding protein binds to a domain containing at
least one of amino acids: 207, 208, 185, 181,439, 513, 538,
539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162, 164, 167, 123, 129, 311,
313,337, 519, 521, and 554 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:
303. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds
to a region containing at least one of amino acids 207, 208,
185, 181, 439, 513, 538, 539, 132, 351, 390, 413, 582, 162,
164, 167, 123, 129, 311,313,337, 519, 521, and 554 of SEQ
ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to
a region containing at least one of amino acids 162, 164, 167,
207 and/or 208 ofSEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some
embodiments, more than one (e.g. , 2, 3, 4, or 5) of the iden-
tified residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP.
In some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 21B12.

In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to
a region containing at least one of amino acid 185 of SEQ ID
NO: I or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, the ABP
competes with ABP 31H4.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to
a region containing at least one of amino acids 439, 513, 538,
and/or 539 of SEQ ID NO: I or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some
embodiments, more than one (e.g. , 2, 3, or 4) of the identified
residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP. In
some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 31A4.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to
a region containing at least one of amino acids 123, 129, 311,
313,337, 132, 351, 390, and/or 413 of SEQ ID NO: I or SEQ
ID NO: 303. In some embodiments, more than one (e.g. , 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) of the identified residues are part of the
region that is bound by the ABP. In some embodiments, the
ABP competes with ABP 12HI I.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to
a region containing at least one of amino acid 582, 519, 521,
and/or 554 of SEQ ID NO: I or SEQ ID NO: 303. In some
embodiments, more than one (e.g. , 2, 3, or 4) of the identified
residues are part of the region that is bound by the ABP. In
some embodiments, the ABP competes with ABP 3C4.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins binds
to the foregoing regions within a fragment or the full length
sequence of SEQ ID NO: I or SEQ ID NO: 303. In other
embodiments, antigen binding proteins bind to polypeptides
consisting of these regions. The reference to "SEQ ID NO: I
or SEQ ID NO: 303" denotes that one or both of these
sequences can be employed or relevant. The phrase does not
denote that only one should be employed.
As noted above, the above description references specific
amino acid positions with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1.How-
ever, throughout the specification generally, reference is
made to a Pro/Cat domain that commences at position 31,
which is provided in SEQ ID NO: 3.As noted below, SEQ ID
NO: I and SEQ ID NO: 303 lack the signal sequence of
PCSK9. As such, any comparison between these various dis-
closures should take this difference in numbering into
account. In particular, any amino acid position in SEQ ID NO:
I, will correspond to an amino acid position 30 amino acids
further into the protein in SEQ ID NO: 3. For example,
position 207 of SEQ ID NO: I, corresponds to position 237 of
SEQ ID NO: 3 (the full length sequence, and the numbering
system used in the present specification generally). Table 39.6
outlines how the above noted positions, which reference SEQ
ID NO: I (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303) correspond to SEQ ID
NO: 3 (which includes the signal sequence). Thus, any of the
above noted embodiments that are described in regard to SEQ
ID NO: I (and/or SEQ ID NO: 303), are described in refer-
ence to SEQ ID NO: 3, by the noted corresponding positions.
In some embodiments, ABP 21B12 binds to an epitope
including residues 162-167 (e.g. , residues D162-E167 of
SEQ ID NO: I). In some embodiments, ABP 12HI I binds to
an epitope that includes residues 123-132 (e.g. , S123-T132of
SEQ ID NO: I). In some embodiments, ABP 12HI I binds to
an epitope that includes residues 311-313(e.g. , A311-D313
of SEQ ID NO: I). In some embodiments, ABPs can bind to
an epitope that includes any one of these strands of sequences.
Competing Antigen Binding Proteins
In another aspect, antigen binding proteins are provided
that compete with one of the exemplified antibodies or func-
tional fragments binding to the epitope described herein for
specific binding to PCSK9. Such antigen binding proteins can
also bind to the same epitope as one of the herein exemplified
antigen binding proteins, or an overlapping epitope. Antigen

the same epitope as the exemplified antigen binding proteins
are expected to show similar functional properties. The exem-
plified antigen binding proteins and fragments include those
described above, including those with the heavy and light
chains, variable region domains and CDRs included in
TABLE 2 And/or FIGS. 2-3 and 15. Thus, as a specific
example, the antigen binding proteins that are provided
include those that compete with an antibody or antigen bind-
ing protein having:
(a) all 6 of the CDRs listed for an antibody listed in FIGS.
2-3 and 15;
(b) a VH and a VL listed for an antibody listed in Table 2;
or
(c) two light chains and two heavy chains as specified for an
antibody listed in Table 2.
Certain Therapeutic Uses and Pharmaceutical Compositions
In certain instances, PCSK9 activity correlates with a num-
ber ofhuman disease states. For example, in certain instances,
too much or too little PCSK9 activity correlates with certain
conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, in cer-
tain instances, modulating PCSK9 activity can be therapeu-
tically useful. In certain embodiments, a neutralizing antigen
binding protein to PCSK9 is used to modulate at least one
PCSK9 activity (e.g. , binding to LDLR). Such methods can
treat and/or prevent and/or reduce the risk of disorders that
relate to elevated serum cholesterol levels or in which
elevated cholesterol levels are relevant.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of
the present disclosure, disorders that relate to, involve, or can
be influenced by varied cholesterol, LDL, or LDLR levels can
be addressed by various embodiments of the antigen binding
proteins. In some embodiments, a "cholesterol related disor-
der" (which includes "serum cholesterol related disorders")
includes any one or more of the following: hypercholester-
olemia, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coro-
nary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Alzhe-
imers disease and generally dyslipidemias, which can be
manifested, for example, by an elevated total serum choles-
terol, elevated LDL, elevated triglycerides, elevated VLDL,
and/or low HDL. Some non-limiting examples of primary
and secondary dyslipidemias that can be treated using an
ABP, either alone, or in combination with one or more other
agents include the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus,
familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial hypertriglyceri-
demia, familial hypercholesterolemias, including heterozy-
gous hypercholesterolemia, homozygous hypercholester-
olemia, familial defective apoplipoprotein B-100;polygenic
hypercholesterolemia; remnant removal disease, hepatic
lipase deficiency; dyslipidemia secondary to any of the fol-
lowing: dietary indiscretion, hypothyroidism, drugs includ-
ing estrogen and progestin therapy, beta-blockers, and thiaz-
ide diuretics; nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure,
Cushing's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, glycogen
storage diseases, hepatoma, cholestasis, acromegaly, insuli-
noma, isolated growth hormone deficiency, and alcohol-in-
duced hypertriglyceridemia. ABP can also be useful in pre-
venting or treating atherosclerotic diseases, such as, for
example, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease,
peripheral arterial disease, stroke (ischaemic and hemor-
rhagic), angina pectoris, or cerebrovascular disease and acute
coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP is useful in reducing the risk of: nonfatal heart
attacks, fatal and non-fatal strokes, certain types of heart
surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, chest pain in patients
with heart disease, and/or cardiovascular events because of
established heart disease such as prior heart attack, prior heart
surgery, and/or chest pain with evidence of clogged arteries.

In some embodiments, the ABP and methods can be used to
reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, diseases or
disorders that are generally addressable (either treatable or
preventable) through the use of statins can also benefit from
the application of the instant antigen binding proteins. In
addition, in some embodiments, disorders or disease that can
benefit from the prevention of cholesterol synthesis or
increased LDLR expression can also be treated by various
embodiments of the antigen binding proteins. In addition, as
will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the use of the
anti-PCSK9 antibodies can be especially useful in the treat-
ment of Diabetes. Not only is Diabetes a risk factor for coro-
nary heart disease, but insulin increases the expression of
PCSK9. That is, people with Diabetes have elevated plasma
lipid levels (which can be related to high PCSK9 levels) and
can benefit from lowering those levels. This is generally dis-
cussed in more detail in Costet et al. ("Hepatic PCSK9
Expression is Regulated by Nutirtional Status via Insulin and
Sterol Regulatiory Element-binding Protein IC", J. Biol.
Chem. , 281:6211-6218,2006), the entirety ofwhich is incor-
porated herein by reference.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein is
administered to those who have diabetes mellitus, abdominal
aortic aneurysm, atherosclerosis and/or peripheral vascular
disease in order to decrease their serum cholesterol levels to a
safer range. In some embodiments, the antigen binding pro-
tein is administered to patients at risk ofdeveloping any ofthe
herein described disorders. In some embodiments, the ABPs
are administered to subjects that smoke, have hypertension or
a familial history of early heart attacks.
In some embodiments, a subject is administered an ABP if
they are at a moderate risk or higher on the 2004 NCEP
treatment goals. In some embodiments, the ABP is adminis-
tered to a subject if the subject's LDL cholesterol level is
greater than 160 mg/dl. In some embodiments, the ABP is
administered if the subjects LDL cholesterol level is greater
than 130 (and they have a moderate or moderately high risk
according to the 2004 NCEP treatment goals). In some
embodiments, the ABP is administered if the subjects LDL
cholesterol level is greater than 100 (and they have a high or
very high risk according to the 2004 NCEP treatment goals).
A physician will be able to select an appropriate treatment
indications and target lipid levels depending on the individual
profile ofa particular patient. One well-accepted standard for
guiding treatment ofhyperlipidemia is the Third Report of the
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert
Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of the High
Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) Final
Report, National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication No.
02-5215 (2002), the printed publication of which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9
are used to decrease the amount of PCSK9 activity from an
abnormally high level or even a normal level. In some
embodiments, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 are used to
treat or prevent hypercholesterolemia and/or in the prepara-
tion of medicaments therefore and/or for other cholesterol
related disorders (such as those noted herein). In certain
embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is used to
treat or prevent conditions such as hypercholesterolemia in
which PCSK9 activity is normal. In such conditions, for
example, reduction of PCSK9 activity to below normal can
provide a therapeutic effect.
In some embodiments, more than one antigen binding pro-
tein to PCSK9 is used to modulate PCSK9 activity.

In certain embodiments, methods are provided of treating a
cholesterol related disorder, such as hypercholesterolemia
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount
of one or more antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 and
another therapeutic agent.
In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 is administered alone. In certain embodiments, an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered prior to the
administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In cer-
tain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is
administered concurrent with the administration of at least
one other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, an anti-
gen binding protein to PCSK9 is administered subsequent to
the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In
other embodiments, an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 is
administered prior to the administration of at least one other
therapeutic agent. Therapeutic agents (apart from the antigen
binding protein), include, but are not limited to, at least one
other cholesterol-lowering (serum and/or total body choles-
terol) agent or an agent. In some embodiments, the agent
increases the expression of LDLR, have been observed to
increase serum HDL levels, lower LDL levels or lower trig-
lyceride levels. Exemplary agents include, but are not limited
to, statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin,
mevastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvasta-
tin), Nicotinic acid (Niacin) (NIACOR, NIASPAN (slow
release niacin), SLO-NIACIN (slow release niacin)), Fibric
acid (LOPID (Gemfibrozil), TRICOR (fenofibrate), Bile acid
sequestrants (QUESTRAN (cholestyramine), colesevelam
(WELCHOL), COLESTID (colestipol)), Cholesterol absorp-
tion inhibitors (ZETIA (ezetimibe)), Combining nicotinic
acid with statin (ADVICOR (LOVASTATIN and NIASPAN),
Combining a statin with an absorption inhibitor (VYTORIN
(ZOCOR and ZETIA) and/or lipid modifying agents. In some
embodiments, the ABP is combined with PPAR gamma agon-
sits, PPAR alpha/gamma agonists, squalene synthase inhibi-
tors, CETP inhibitors, anti-hypertensives, anti-diabetic
agents (such as sulphonyl ureas, insulin, GLP-I analogs,
DDPIV inhibitors), ApoB modulators, MTP inhibitoris and/
or arteriosclerosis obliterans treatments. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP is combined with an agent that increases the
level of LDLR protein in a subject, such as statins, certain
cytokines like oncostatin M, estrogen, and/or certain herbal
ingredients such as berberine. In some embodiments, the
ABP is combined with an agent that increases serum choles-
terol levels in a subject (such as certain anti-psycotic agents,
certain HIV protease inhibitors, dietary factors such as high
fructose, sucrose, cholesterol or certain fatty acids and certain
nuclear receptor agonists and antagonists for RXR, RAR,
LXR, FXR). In some embodiments, the ABP is combined
with an agent that increases the level of PCSK9 in a subject,
such as statins and/or insulin. The combination of the two can
allow for the undesirable side-effects of other agents to be
mitigated by the ABP. As will be appreciated by one of skill in
the art, in some embodiments, the ABP is combined with the
other agent/compound. In some embodiments, the ABP and
other agent are administered concurrently. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP and other agent are not administered simul-
taneously, with the ABP being administered before or after
the agent is administered. In some embodiments, the subject
receives both the ABP and the other agent (that increases the
level of LDLR) during a same period of prevention, occur-
rence of a disorder, and/or period of treatment.
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be
administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with
other agents. In certain embodiments, the combination
therapy comprises an antigen binding protein capable of
67
US 8,829,165 B2
68
binding PCSK9, in combination with at least one anti-cho-
lesterol agent. Agents include, but are not limited to, in vitro
synthetically prepared chemical compositions, antibodies,
antigen binding regions, and combinations and conjugates
thereof. In certain embodiments, an agent can act as an ago-
nist, antagonist, allosteric modulator, or toxin. In certain
embodiments, an agent can act to inhibit or stimulate its target
(e.g. , receptor or enzyme activation or inhibition), and
thereby promote increased expression of LDLR or decrease
serum cholesterol levels.
In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 can be administered prior to, concurrent with, and
subsequent to treatment with a cholesterol-lowering (serum
and/or total cholesterol) agent. In certain embodiments, an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be administered pro-
phylactically to prevent or mitigate the onset ofhypercholes-
terolemia, heart disease, diabetes, and/or any of the choles-
terol related disorder. In certain embodiments, an antigen
binding protein to PCSK9 can be administered for the treat-
ment of an existing hypercholesterolemia condition. In some
embodiments, the ABP delays the onset of the disorder and/or
symptoms associated with the disorder. In some embodi-
ments, the ABP is provided to a subject lacking any symptoms
of any one of the cholesterol related disorders or a subset
thereof.
In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 is used with particular therapeutic agents to treat
various cholesterol related disorders, such as hypercholester-
olemia. In certain embodiments, in view of the condition and
the desired level of treatment, two, three, or more agents can
be administered. In certain embodiments, such agents can be
provided together by inclusion in the same formulation. In
certain embodiments, such agent(s) and an antigen binding
protein to PCSK9 can be provided together by inclusion in the
same formulation. In certain embodiments, such agents can
be formulated separately and provided together by inclusion
in a treatment kit. In certain embodiments, such agents and an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be formulated sepa-
rately and provided together by inclusion in a treatment kit. In
certain embodiments, such agents can be provided separately.
In certain embodiments, when administered by gene therapy,
the genes encoding protein agents and/or an antigen binding
protein to PCSK9 can be included in the same vector. In
certain embodiments, the genes encoding protein agents and/
or an antigen binding protein to PCSK9 can be under the
control of the same promoter region. In certain embodiments,
the genes encoding protein agents and/or an antigen binding
protein to PCSK9 can be in separate vectors.
In certain embodiments, the invention provides for phar-
maceutical compositions comprising an antigen binding pro-
tein to PCSK9 together with a pharmaceutically acceptable
diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsifier, preservative and/or
adjuvant.
In certain embodiments, the invention provides for phar-
maceutical compositions comprising an antigen binding pro-
tein to PCSK9 and a therapeutically effective amount of at
least one additional therapeutic agent, together with a phar-
maceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsi-
fier, preservative and/or adjuvant.
In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 can be used with at least one therapeutic agent for
inflammation. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding
protein to PCSK9 can be used with at least one therapeutic
agent for an immune disorder. Exemplary therapeutic agents
for inflammation and immune disorders include, but are not
limited to cyclooxygenase type I (COX- I) and cyclooxyge-
nase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors small molecule modulators of

In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions will
include more than one different antigen binding protein to
PCSK9. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical composi-
tions will include more than one antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 wherein the antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 bind
more than one epitope. In some embodiments, the various
antigen binding proteins will not compete with one another
for binding to PCSK9. In some embodiments, any of the
antigen binding proteins depicted in Table 2 and FIGS. 2
and/or 3 can be combined together in a pharmaceutical com-
position.
In certain embodiments, acceptable formulation materials
preferably are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and con-
centrations employed. In some embodiments, the formulation
material(s) are for s.c. and/or I.V. administration. In certain
embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can contain
formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserv-
ing, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color,
isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or
release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. In cer-
tain embodiments, suitable formulation materials include, but
are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine,
asparagine, arginine or Iysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants
(such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-
sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCI, cit-
rates, phosphates or other organic acids); bulking agents
(such as mannitol or glycine); chelating agents (such as eth-
ylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents
(such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or
hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides;
disaccharides; and other carbohydrates (such as glucose,
mannose or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gela-
tin or immunoglobulins); coloring, flavoring and diluting
agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as
polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides;
salt-forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives
(such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid,
thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylpara-
ben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); sol-
vents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene
glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); sus-
pending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as plu-
ronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysor-
bate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin,
cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as
sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali
metal halides, preferably sodium or potassium chloride, man-
nitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or
pharmaceutical adjuvants. (Remi ngton 's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 18' Edition, A. R. Gennaro, ed. , Mack Publishing
Company (1995). In some embodiments, the formulation
comprises PBS; 20 mM NaOAC, pH 5.2, 50 mM NaCI;
and/or 10 mM NAOAC, pH 5.2, 9% Sucrose.
In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 and/or a therapeutic molecule is linked to a half-life
extending vehicle known in the art. Such vehicles include, but
are not limited to, polyethylene glycol, glycogen (e.g. , gly-
cosylation of the ABP), and dextran. Such vehicles are
69

70
described, e.g. , in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/428, 082, now
U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843 and published PCT Application No.
WO 99/25044, which are hereby incorporated by reference
for any purpose.
In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical com-
position will be determined by one skilled in the art depend-
ing upon, for example, the intended route of administration,
delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, Rem-
ington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra. In certain embodi-
ments, such compositions may influence the physical state,
stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of
the antibodies of the invention.
In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier in a
pharmaceutical composition can be either aqueous or non-
aqueous in nature. For example, in certain embodiments, a
suitable vehicle or carrier can be water for injection, physi-
ological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, pos-
sibly supplemented with other materials common in compo-
sitions for parenteral administration. In some embodiments,
the saline comprises isotonic phosphate-buffered saline. In
certain embodiments, neutral buffered saline or saline mixed
with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In certain
embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris
buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH
4.0-5.5, which can further include sorbitol or a suitable sub-
stitute there fore. In certain embodiments, a composition com-
prising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without
at least one additional therapeutic agents, can be prepared for
storage by mixing the selected composition having the
desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents
(Remi ngton 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of
a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, in certain
embodiments, a composition comprising an antigen binding
protein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional
therapeutic agents, can be formulated as a lyophilizate using
appropriate excipients such as sucrose.
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition
can be selected for parenteral delivery. In certain embodi-
ments, the compositions can be selected for inhalation or for
delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. The prepa-
ration of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is
within the ability of one skilled in the art.
In certain embodiments, the formulation components are
present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of
administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to
maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly
lower pH, typically within a pH range offrom about 5 to about
8.
In certain embodiments, when parenteral administration is
contemplated, a therapeutic composition can be in the form of
a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution
comprising a desired antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with
or without additional therapeutic agents, in a pharmaceuti-
cally acceptable vehicle. In certain embodiments, a vehicle
for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least
one additional therapeutic agent, is formulated as a sterile,
isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodi-
ments, the preparation can involve the formulation of the
desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable micro-
spheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such
as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes,
that can provide for the controlled or sustained release of the
product which can then be delivered via a depot injection. In
certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid can also be used, and
can have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the

circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug deliv-
ery devices can be used to introduce the desired molecule.
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can
be formulated for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least
one additional therapeutic agent, can be formulated as a dry
powder for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an inhalation
solution comprising an antigen binding protein to PCSK9,
with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, can
be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain
embodiments, solutions can be nebulized. Pulmonary admin-
istration is further described in PCT application no. PCT/
US94/001875, which describes pulmonary delivery of
chemically modified proteins.
In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that formula-
tions can be administered orally. In certain embodiments, an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least
one additional therapeutic agents, that is administered in this
fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers
customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms
such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a cap-
sule can be designed to release the active portion of the
formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when
bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is
minimized. In certain embodiments, at least one additional
agent can be included to facilitate absorption of an antigen
binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic
agents. In certain embodiments, diluents, flavorings, low
melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending
agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders can also be
employed.
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can
involve an effective quantity of an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic
agents, in a mixture with non-toxic excipients which are
suitable for the manufacture of tablets. In certain embodi-
ments, by dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another
appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit-dose
form. In certain embodiments, suitable excipients include,
but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbon-
ate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium
phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or aca-
cia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic
acid, or talc.
Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to
those skilled in the art, including formulations involving anti-
gen binding proteins to PCSK9, with or without at least one
additional therapeutic agent(s), in sustained- or controlled-
delivery formulations. In certain embodiments, techniques
for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-
delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible
microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also
known to those skilled in the art. See for example, PCT
Application No. PCT/US93/00829 which describes the con-
trolled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the
delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. In certain embodi-
ments, sustained-release preparations can include semiper-
meable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g.
films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices can
include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No.
3,773,919 and EP 058,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid
and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al. , Biopolymers,
22:547-556 (1983)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate)
(Langer et al. , J.Biomed. Mater. Res. , 15:167-277(1981)and
Langer, Chem. Tech. , 12:98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl
acetate (Langer et al. , supra) or poly-D( —)-3-hydroxybutyrlc
acid (EP 133,988). In certain embodiments, sustained release
71
US 8,829,165 B2
72
compositions can also include liposomes, which can be pre-
pared by any of several methods known in the art. See, e.g. ,
Eppstein et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:3688-3692
(1985); EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949.
The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo
administration typically is sterile. In certain embodiments,
this can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration
membranes. In certain embodiments, where the composition
is lyophilized, sterilization using this method can be con-
ducted either prior to or following lyophilization and recon-
stitution. In certain embodiments, the composition for
parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or
in a solution. In certain embodiments, parenteral composi-
tions generally are placed into a container having a sterile
access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial
having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.
In certain embodiments, once the pharmaceutical compo-
sition has been formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as
a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehy-
drated or lyophilized powder. In certain embodiments, such
formulations can be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in
a form (e.g. , Iyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to admin-
istration.
In certain embodiments, kits are provided for producing a
single-dose administration unit. In certain embodiments, the
kit can contain both a first container having a dried protein
and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In
certain embodiments, kits containing single and multi-cham-
bered pre-filled syringes (e.g. , liquid syringes and lyosy-
ringes) are included.
In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a pharma-
ceutical composition comprising an antigen binding protein
to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional therapeutic
agent, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for
example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One
skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage
levels for treatment, according to certain embodiments, will
thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the
indication for which an antigen binding protein to PCSK9,
with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is
being used, the route of administration, and the size (body
weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age
and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the
clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of admin-
istration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. In certain
embodiments, a typical dosage can range from about 0.1
pg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the
factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage
can range from 0.1 pg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or I pg/kg
up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 pg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.
In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing will take
into account the pharmacokinetic parameters of an antigen
binding protein to PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic
agents in the formulation used. In certain embodiments, a
clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is
reached that achieves the desired effect. In certain embodi-
ments, the composition can therefore be administered as a
single dose, or as two or more doses (which may or may not
contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time,
or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or
catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is rou-
tinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within
the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. In certain
embodiments, appropriate dosages can be ascertained
through use of appropriate dose-response data. In some
embodiments, the amount and frequency of administration
can take into account the desired cholesterol level (serum

and/or total) to be obtained and the subject's present choles-
terol level, LDL level, and/or LDLR levels, all of which can
be obtained by methods that are well known to those of skill
in the art.
In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the
pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known meth-
ods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperito-
neal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroven-
tricular, intramuscular, subcutaneously, intra-ocular,
intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained
release systems or by implantation devices. In certain
embodiments, the compositions can be administered by bolus
injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation
device.
In certain embodiments, the composition can be adminis-
tered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or
another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule
has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments,
where an implantation device is used, the device can be
implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery ofthe
desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or
continuous administration.
In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to use a phar-
maceutical composition comprising an antigen binding pro-
tein to PCSK9, with or without at least one additional thera-
peutic agent, in an ex vivo manner. In such instances, cells,
tissues and/or organs that have been removed from the patient
are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an
antigen binding protein to PCSK9, with or without at least
one additional therapeutic agent, after which the cells, tissues
and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the
patient.
In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein to
PCSK9 and/or any additional therapeutic agents can be deliv-
ered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically
engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to
express and secrete the polypeptides. In certain embodi-
ments, such cells can be animal or human cells, and can be
autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodi-
ments, the cells can be immortalized. In certain embodiments,
in order to decrease the chance of an immunological
response, the cells can be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of
surrounding tissues. In certain embodiments, the encapsula-
tion materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable
polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of
the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells
by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental fac-
tors from the surrounding tissues.
Based on the ability of ABPs to significantly neutralize
PCSK9 activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below),
these ABPs will have therapeutic effects in treating and pre-
venting symptoms and conditions resulting from PCSK9-
mediated activity, such as hypercholesterolemia.
Diagnostic Applications
In some embodiments, the ABP is used as a diagnostic tool.
The ABP can be used to assay the amount of PCSK9 present
in a sample and/or subject. As will be appreciated by one of
skill in the art, such ABPs need not be neutralizing ABPs. In
some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP is not a neutralizing
ABP. In some embodiments, the diagnostic ABP binds to a
different epitope than the neutralizing ABP binds to. In some
embodiments, the two ABPs do not compete with one
another.
In some embodiments, the ABPs disclosed herein are used
or provided in an assay kit and/or method for the detection of
PCSK9 in mammalian tissues or cells in order to screen/
diagnose for a disease or disorder associated with changes in
73
US 8,829,165 B2
74
levels of PCSK9. The kit comprises an ABP that binds
PCSK9 and means for indicating the binding of the ABP with
PCSK9, if present, and optionally PCSK9 protein levels.
Various means for indicating the presence of an ABP can be
used. For example, fluorophores, other molecular probes, or
enzymes can be linked to the ABP and the presence of the
ABP can be observed in a variety of ways. The method for
screening for such disorders can involve the use of the kit, or
simply the use of one of the disclosed ABPs and the determi-
nation of whether the ABP binds to PCSK9 in a sample. As
will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, high or elevated
levels of PCSK9 will result in larger amounts of the ABP
binding to PCSK9 in the sample. Thus, degree ofABP bind-
ing can be used to determine how much PCS K9 is in a sample.
Subjects or samples with an amount of PCSK9 that is greater
than a predetermined amount (e.g. , an amount or range that a
person without a PCSK9 related disorder would have) can be
characterized as having a PCSK9 mediated disorder. In some
embodiments, the ABP is administered to a subject taking a
statin, in order to determine if the statin has increased the
amount of PCSK9 in the subject.
In some embodiments, the ABP is a non-neutralizing ABP
and is used to determine the amount of PCSK9 in a subject
receiving an ABP and/or statin treatment.

Generation ofAnti-PCSK9 Antibodies and Hybridomas
Antibodies to the mature form of PCSK9 (depicted as the
sequence in FIG. 1A, with the pro-domain underlined), were
raised in XenoMouse mice (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif),
which are mice containing human immunoglobulin genes.
Two groups ofXenoMouse mice, group I and 2, were used
to produce antibodies to PCSK9. Group I included mice of
the XenoMouse strain XMG2-KL, which produces fully
human IgG2 and IgG21c antibodies. Group I mice were
immunized with human PCSK9. PCSK9 was prepared using
standard recombinant techniques using the GenBank
sequence as reference (NM 174936).Group 2 involved mice
of the XenoMouse strain XMG4-KL, which produce fully
human IgG4 and IgG41c antibodies. Group 2 mice were also
immunized with human PCSK9.
The mice ofboth groups were injected with antigen eleven
times, according to the schedule in Table 3. In the initial
immunizations, each mouse was injected with a total of 10 pg
of antigen delivered intraperitoneally into the abdomen. Sub-
sequent boosts are 5 ug doses and injection method is stag-
gered between intraperitoneal injections into the abdomen
and sub-cutaneous injections at the base of the tail. For intra-
peritoneal injections antigen is prepared as an emulsion with
TiterMax Gold (Sigma, Cat ¹T2684) and for subcutaneous
injections antigen is mixed with Alum (aluminum phosphate)
and CpG oligos. In injections 2 through 8 and 10, each mouse
was injected with a total of 5 pg of antigen in the adjuvant
alum gel. A final injection of 5 pg of antigen per mouse is
delivered in Phospho buffered saline and delivered into 2 sites
harvest
The protocol used to titer the XenoMouse animals was as
follows: Costar 3368 medium binding plates were coated
with neutravadin @8 ug/ml (50 ul/well) and incubated at 4'
C. in I xPBS/0. 05% azide overnight. They were washed using
45
TiterTek 3-cycle wash with RO water. Plates were blocked
using 250 ul of I xPBS/1% milk and incubated for at least 30
minutes at RT. Block was washed off using TiterTek 3-cycle
wash with RO water. One then captured b-human PCSK9 @
2 ug/ml in I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca2+ (assay diluent) 50
ul/well and incubated for I hr at RT. One then washed using

M384 plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala. ). A 3-cycle
wash was performed. The plates were blocked with 250 pl of
I xPBS/1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at
room temperature. The plates were then washed using the
M384 plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. The
capture was b-hu PCSK9, without a V5 tag, and was added at
2 pg/ml in 1xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca (40 pl/well). The
plates were then incubated for I hour at room temperature. A
3-cycle wash was performed. Sera were titrated I:3 in dupli-
cate from I:100,and row H was blank for sera. The titration
was done in assay diluent, at a volume of 50 pl/well. The
plates were incubated for I hour at room temperature. Next, a
3-cycle wash was performed. Goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP

hydrochloric acid (50 pl/well) after 30 minutes at room tem-
perature. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a
Titertek plate reader.
Positive controls to detect plate bound PCSK9 were

ng/ml in assay diluent. Negative control was naive XMG2-
KL and XMG4-KL sera titrated I:3in duplicate from I:100in
assay diluent.
For samples comprising b-PCSK9 with a VSH is tag the
following protocol was employed: Costar 3368medium bind-
ing plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed. The plates
were coated with neutravadin at 8 pg/ml in I xPBS/0. 05%
Azide, (50 pl/well). The plates were incubated at 4' C. over-
night. The plates were then washed using a Titertek M384
plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala. ).A 3-cycle wash was
performed. The plates were blocked with 250 pl of I xPBS/
1% milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room
temperature. The plates were then washed using the M384
plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. The capture was
b-hu PCSK9, with a V5 tag, and was added at 2 pg/ml in
I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca (40 pl/well). The plates were
then incubated for I hour at room temperature. A 3-cycle
wash was performed. Sera were titrated I:3 in duplicate from
I:100,and row H was blank for sera. The titration was done in
assay diluent, at a volume of 50 pl/well. The plates were
incubated for I hour at room temperature. Next, the plates
were washed using the M384 plate washer operated using a
3-cycle wash. Goat anti Human IgG Fc HRP at 400 ng/ml in
I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca was added at 50 pl/well to the
plate and the plate was incubated I hour at room temperature.
The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle wash. The
plates were then patted dry with paper towel. Finally, I step
TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) (50 pl/well) was added to the
plate and the plate was quenched with IN hydrochloric acid
(50 pl/well) after 30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were
read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.

diluent; both detected with goat anti-human IgG Fc HRP at a
concentration of400 ng/ml in assay diluent. Negative control
was naive XMG2-KL and XMG4-KL sera titrated I:3 in
duplicate from I:100in assay diluent.
Titers of the antibody against human PCSK9 were tested
by ELISA assay for mice immunized with soluble antigen as
described. Table 4 summarizes the ELISA data and indicates
that there were some mice which appeared to be specific for
PCSK9. See, e.g. , Table 4. Therefore, at the end of the immu-
nization program, 10 mice (in bold in Table 4) were selected
for harvest, and splenocytes and lymphocytes were isolated
from the spleens and lymph nodes respectively, as described
herein.

Example 2
Recovery of Lymphocytes, B-Cell Isolations,
Fusions and Generation of Hybridomas
This example outlines how the immune cells were recov-
ered and the hybridomas were generated. Selected immu-
nized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the
draining lymph nodes were harvested and pooled from each
cohort. The B cells were dissociated from lymphoid tissue by
grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues, and
the cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted,
and 0.9 ml DMEM per 100million lymphocytes was added to
the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely.
Lymphocytes were mixed with nonsecretory myeloma
P3X63Ag8. 653 cells purchased from ATCC, cat. ¹CRL 1580
(Kearney et al. , (1979)J. Immunol. 123, 1548-1550)at a ratio
of I:4.The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation
at 400xg 4 min. After decanting of the supernatant, the cells
were gently mixed using a I ml pipette. Preheated PEG/
DMSO solution from Sigma (cat¹P7306) (I ml per million of
B-cells) was slowly added with gentle agitation over I min

followed by I min of mixing. Preheated IDMEM (2 ml per
million of B cells) (DMEM without glutamine, L-glutamine,
pen/strep, MEM non-essential amino acids (all from Invitro-
gen), was then added over 2 minutes with gentle agitation.
Finally preheated IDMEM (8 ml per 10 B-cells) was added
over 3 minutes.
The fused cells were spun down 400xg 6 min and resus-
pended in 20 ml selection media (DMEM (Invitrogen), 15%
FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, pen/strep,
MEM Non-essential amino acids, Sodium Pyruvate, 2-Mer-
captoethanol (all from Invitrogen), HA-Azaserine Hypoxan-
thine and OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin) (both
from Sigma) and IL-6 (Boehrlnger Mannheim)) per million
B-cells. Cells were incubated for 20-30 min at 37 C and then
resuspended in 200 ml selection media and cultured for 3-4
days in T175 flask prior to 96 well plating. Thus, hybridomas
that produced antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 were pro-
duced.
Example 3
Selection of PCSK9 Antibodies
The present example outlines how the various PCSK9 anti-
gen binding proteins were characterized and selected. The
binding of secreted antibodies (produced from the hybrido-
mas produced in Examples I and 2) to PCSK9 was assessed.
Selection of antibodies was based on binding data and inhi-
bition of PCSK9 binding to LDLR and affinity. Binding to
soluble PCSK9 was analyzed by ELISA, as described below.
BIAcore (surface plasmon resonance) was used to quantify
binding affinity.
Primary Screen
A primary screen for antibodies which bind to wild-type
PCSK9 was performed. The primary screen was performed
on two harvests. The primary screen comprised an ELISA
assay and was performed using the following protocol:
Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life
Sciences) were employed. The plates were coated with neu-
travadin at a concentration of4 pg/ml in I xPBS/0. 05%Azide,
at a volume of 40 pl/well. The plates were incubated at 4' C.
overnight. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate
washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala. ).A 3-cycle wash was per-
formed. The plates were blocked with 90 pl of IxPBS/1%
milk and incubated approximately 30 minutes at room tem-
perature. The plates were then washed. Again, a 3-cycle wash
was performed. The capture sample was biotinylated-
PCSK9, without a V5 tag, and was added at 0.9 pg/ml in
I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca at a volume of 40 pl/well. The
plates were then incubated for I hour at room temperature.
Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer
operated using a 3-cycle wash. 10 pl of supernatant was
transferred into 40 pl of IxPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca and
incubated 1.5 hours at room temperature. Again the plates
were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a
3-cycle wash. 40 pl/well of Goat anti-Human IgG Fc POD at
a concentration of 100 ng/ml (I:4000) in I xPBS/1% milk/10
mM Ca was added to the plate and was incubated I hour at
room temperature. The plates were washed once again, using
a 3-cycle wash. Finally, 40 pl/well of One-step TMB (Neo-
gen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and quenching
with 40 pl/well of IN hydrochloric acid was performed after
30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immedi-
ately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.
The primary screen resulted in a total of 3104 antigen
specific hybridomas being identified from the two harvests.

Based on highest ELISA OD, 1500 hybridomas per harvest
were advanced for a total of 3000 positives.
Confirmatory Screen
The 3000 positives were then rescreened for binding to
wild-type PCSK9 to confirm stable hybridomas were estab-
lished. The screen was performed as follows: Costar 3702
medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences)
were employed. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 3
pg/ml in I xPBS/0. 05% Azide at a volume of 40 pl/well. The
plates were incubated at 4' C. overnight. The plates were then
washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville,
Ala. ). A 3-cycle wash was performed. The plates were
blocked with 90 of I xPBS/1% milk and incubated approxi-
mately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then
washed using the M384 plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was
performed. The capture sample was b-PCSK9, without a V5
tag, and was added at 0.9 pg/ml in I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM
Ca at a volume of40 pl/well. The plates were then incubated
for I hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed
using a 3-cycle wash. 10pl of supernatant was trans ferred into
40 of I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca and incubated 1.5 hours
at room temperature. Again the plates were washed using the
Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 40
pl/well ofGoat anti-Human IgG Fc POD at a concentration of
100 ng/ml (I:4000) in IxPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca was
added to the plate, and the plate was incubated I hour at room
temperature. The plates were washed once again, using the
Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Finally,
40 pl/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was
added to the plate and was quenched with 40 pl/well of IN
hydrochloric acid after 30minutes at room temperature. OD' s
were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate
reader A total of2441 positives repeated in the second screen.
These antibodies were then used in the subsequent screen-
ings.
Mouse Cross-Reactivity Screen
The panel of hybridomas was then screened for cross-
reactivity to mouse PCSK9 to make certain that the antibodies
could bind to both human and mouse PCSK9. The following
protocol was employed in the cross-reactivity screen: Costar
3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sci-
ences) were employed. The plates were coated with neutra-
vadin at 3 pg/ml in I xPBS/0. 05% Azide at a volume of 40
pl/well. The plates were incubated at 4' C. overnight. The
plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titer-
tek, Huntsville, Ala. ). A 3-cycle wash was performed. The
plates were blocked with 90 pl of I xPBS/1% milk and incu-
bated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The
plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer. A
3-cycle wash was performed. The capture sample was bioti-
nylated-mouse PCSK9, and was added at I pg/ml in I xPBS/
1% milk/10 mM Ca at a volume of 40 pl/well. The plates
were then incubated for I hour at room temperature. Next, the
plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated
using a 3-cycle wash. 50 pl of supernatant was transferred to
the plates and incubated I hour at room temperature. Again
the plates were washed using a 3-cycle wash. 40 pl/well of
Goat anti-Human IgG Fc POD at a concentration of 100
ng/ml (I:4000)in I xPBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca was added to
the plate and the plate was incubated I hour at room tempera-
ture. The plates were washed once again, using a 3-cycle
wash. Finally, 40 pl/well One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington,
Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 pl/well
of IN hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room tempera-
ture. OD's were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek
79
US 8,829,165 B2
80
plate reader. 579 antibodies were observed to cross-react with
mouse PCSK9. These antibodies were then used in the sub-
sequent screenings.
D374Y Mutant Binding Screen
The D374Y mutation in PCSK9 has been documented in
the human population (e.g. , Timms K M et al, "A mutation in
PCSK9 causing autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia
in a Utah pedigree", Hum. Genet. 114: 349-353, 2004). In
order to determine if the antibodies were specific for the wild
type or also bound to the D374Y form ofPCSK9, the samples
were then screened for binding to the mutant PCSK9
sequence comprising the mutation D374Y. The protocol for
the screen was as follows: Costar 3702 medium binding 384
well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the
screen. The plates were coated with neutravadin at 4 pg/ml in
IxPBS/0. 05'zo Azide at a volume of 40 pl/well. The plates
were incubated at 4' C. overnight. The plates were then
washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville,
Ala. ). A 3-cycle wash was performed. The plates were
blocked with 90 pl of I xPBS/I 'zo milk and incubated approxi-
mately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then
washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was
performed. The plates were coated with biotinylated human
PCSK9 D374Y at a concentration of I pg/ml in I xPBS/I'zo
milk/10 mMCa and incubated for I hour at room tempera-
ture. The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate
washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. Late exhaust hybri-
doma culture supernatant was diluted I:5 in PBS/milk/Ca
(10ml plus 40 ml) and incubated for I hour at room tempera-
ture. Next, 40 pl/well of rabbit anti-human PCSK9 (Cayman
Chemical) and human anti-His 1.23 I:2at I ug/ml in I xPBS/
I '/o milk/10 mMCa + was titrated onto the plates, which were
then incubated for I hour at room temperature. The plates
were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle
wash was performed. 40 pl/well of Goat anti-Human IgG Fc
HRP at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (I:4000) in I xPBS/I'zo
milk/10 mM Ca was added to the plate and the plate was
incubated I hour at room temperature. 40 pl/well of Goat
anti-rabbit IgG Fc HRP at a concentration of 100 ng/ml
(I:4000) in IxPBS/I'zo milk/10 mM Ca was added to the
plate and the plate was incubated I hour at room temperature.
The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A
3-cycle wash was performed. Finally, 40 pl/well of One-step
TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and
was quenched with 40 pl/well of IN hydrochloric acid after
30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immedi-
ately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader. Over 96'zo of the
positive hits on the wild-type PCSK9 also bound mutant
PCSK9.
Large Scale Receptor Ligand Blocking Screen
To screen for the antibodies that block PCSK9 binding to
LDLR an assay was developed using the D374Y PCSK9
mutant. The mutant was used for this assay because it has a
higher binding affinity to LDLR allowing a more sensitive
receptor ligand blocking assay to be developed. The follow-
ing protocol was employed in the receptor ligand blocking
screen: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corn-
ing Life Sciences) were employed in the screen. The plates
were coated with goat anti-LDLR (R&D Cat ¹AF2148) at 2
pg/ml in I xPBS/0. 05'zo Azide at a volume of 40 pl/well. The
plates were incubated at 4' C. overnight. The plates were then
washed using a Titertek plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville,
Ala. ). A 3-cycle wash was performed. The plates were
blocked with 90 pl of I xPBS/I 'zo milk and incubated approxi-
mately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then
washed using the Titertek plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was
performed. The capture sample was LDLR (R&D, Cat

¹2148LD/CF), and was added at 0.4 pg/ml in IxPBS/I'zo
milk/10 mM Ca at a volume of 40 pl/well. The plates were
then incubated for I hour and 10 minutes at room tempera-
ture. Contemporaneously, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated human
D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 15 microliters of hybri-
doma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypropylene plates and
the exhaust supernatant concentration was diluted I:5.The
plates were then pre-incubated for about I hour and 30 min-
utes at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed using
the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 50
pl/well of the pre-incubated mixture was transferred onto the
LDLR coated ELISA plates and incubated for I hour at room
temperature. To detect LDLR-bound b-PCSK9, 40 pl/well
streptavidin HRP at 500 ng/ml in assay diluent was added to
the plates. The plates were incubated for I hour at room
temperature. The plates were again washed using a Titertek
plate washer. A 3-cycle wash was performed. Finally, 40
pl/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was
added to the plate and was quenched with 40 pl/well of IN
hydrochloric acid after 30minutes at room temperature. OD' s
were read immediately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate
reader. The screen identified 384 antibodies that blocked the
interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR well, 100antibod-
ies blocked the interaction strongly (OD(0.3).These antibod-
ies inhibited the binding interaction of PCSK9 and LDLR
greater than 90'zo (greater than 90'zo inhibition).
Receptor Ligand Binding Assay on Blocker Subset
The receptor ligand assay was then repeated using the
mutant enzyme on the 384 member subset of neutralizers
identified in the first large scale receptor ligand inhibition
assay. The same protocol was employed in the screen of the
384 member blocker subset assay as was done in the large
scale receptor ligandblocking screen. This repeat screen con-
firmed the initial screening data.
This screen of the 384 member subset identified 85 anti-
bodies that blocked interaction between the PCSK9 mutant
enzyme and the LDLR greater than 90'zo.
Receptor Ligand Binding Assay of Blockers that Bind the
Wild Type PCSK9 but not the D374Y Mutant
In the initial panel of 3000 sups there were 86 antibodies
shown to specifically bind to the wild-type PCSK9 and not to
the huPCSK9 (D374Y) mutant. These 86 sups were tested for
the ability to block wild-type PCSK9 binding to the LDLR
receptor. The following protocol was employed: Costar 3702
medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences)
were employed in the screen. The plates were coated with
anti-His 1.23 at 10pg/ml in I xPBS/0. 05'zo Azide at a volume
of 40 pl/well. The plates were incubated at 4' C. overnight.
The plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer
(Titertek, Huntsville, Ala. ).A 3-cycle wash was performed.
The plates were blocked with 90 pl of IxPBS/I'zo milk and
incubated approximately 30 minutes at room temperature.
The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer.
A 3-cycle wash was performed. LDLR (R&D Systems,
¹2148LD/CF or R&D Systems, ¹2148LD) was added at 5
pg/ml in IxPBS/I'zo milk/10 mM Ca at a volume of 40
pl/well. The plates were then incubated for I hour at room
temperature. Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek
plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Contemporane-
ously, biotinylated human wild-type PCSK9 was pre-incu-
bated with hybridoma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypro-
pylene plates. 22 pl ofhybridoma sup was transferred into 33
ul ofb-PCSK9 at a concentration of 583 ng/ml in I xPBS/I'zo
milk/10 mMCa2+, giving a final b-PCSK9 concentra-
tion=350 ng/ml and the exhaust supernatant at a final dilution
of I:2.5. The plates were pre-incubated for approximately I
hour and 30 minutes at room temperature. 50 pl/well of the
81
US 8,829,165 B2
82
preincubated mixture was transferred onto LDLR captured
ELISA plates and incubated for I hour at room temperature.
The plates were then washed using the Titertek plate washer.
A 3-cycle wash was performed. 40 pl/well streptavidin HRP
at 500 ng/ml in assay diluent was added to the plates. The
plates were incubated for I hour at room temperature. The
plates were then washed using a Titertek plate washer. A
3-cycle wash was performed. Finally, 40 pl/well of One-step
TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and
was quenched with 40 pl/well of IN hydrochloric acid after
30 minutes at room temperature. OD's were read immedi-
ately at 450 nm using a Titertek plate reader.
Screening Results
Based on the results of the as says described, several hybri-
doma lines were identified as producing antibodies with
desired interactions with PCSK9. Limiting dilution was used
to isolate a manageable number ofclones from each line. The
clones were designated by hybridoma line number (e.g.
21B12) and clone number (e.g. 21B12.1). In general, no
difference among the different clones ofa particular line were
detected by the functional assays described herein. In a few
cases, clones were identified from a particular line that
behaved differently in the functional assays, for example,
25A7. 1 was found not to block PCSK9/LDLR but 25A73
(referred to herein as 25A7) was neutralizing. The isolated
clones were each expanded in 50-100ml ofhybridoma media
and allowed to grow to exhaustion, (Le., less than about 10%
cell viability). The concentration and potency of the antibod-
ies to PCSK9 in the supernatants of those cultures were deter-
mined by ELISA and by in vitro functional testing, as
described herein. As a result of the screening described
herein, the hybridomas with the highest titer of antibodies to
PCSK9 were identified. The selected hybridomas are shown
in FIGS. 2A-3D and Table 2.
Example 4.1
Production of Human 31H4 IgG4 Antibodies from
Hybridomas
This example generally describes how one of the antigen
binding proteins was produced from a hybridoma line. The
production work used 50 ml exhaust supernatant generation
followed by protein A purification. Integra production was for
scale up and was performed later. Hybridoma line 31H4 was
grown in T75 flasks in 20 ml of media (Integra Media, Table
5). When the hybridoma was nearly confluent in the T75
flasks, it was transferred to an Integra flask (Integra Bio-
sciences, Integra CL1000, cat¹90 005).
The Integra flask is a cell culture flask that is divided by a
membrane into two chambers, a small chamber and a large
chamber. A volume of 20-30 ml hybridoma cells at a mini-
mum cell density of I x10 cells per ml from the 31H4 hybri-
doma line was placed into the small chamber of an Integra
flask in Integra media (see Table 5 for components of Integra
media). Integra media alone (I L) was placed in the large
chambers of the Integra flasks. The membrane separating the
two chambers is permeable to small molecular weight nutri-
ents but is impermeable to hybridoma cells and to antibodies
produced by those cells. Thus, the hybridoma cells and the
antibodies produced by those hybridoma cells were retained
in the small chamber.
After one week, media was removed from both chambers
ofthe Integra flask and was replaced with fresh Integra media.
The collected media from the small chambers was separately
retained. After a second week of growth, the media from the
small chamber was again collected. The collected media from

week I from the hybridoma line was combined with the
collected media from week 2 from the hybridoma line. The
resulting collected media sample from the hybridoma line
was spun to remove cells and debris (15minutes at 3000 rpm)
and the resulting supernatant was filtered (0.22 um). Clarified
conditioned media was loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose
column. Optionally, the media can be first concentrated and
then loaded onto a Protein A Sepharose column. Non-specific
bindings were removed by an extensive PBS wash. Bound
antibody proteins on the Protein A column were recovered by
standard acidic antibody elution from Protein A columns
(such as 50 mM Citrate, pH 3.0). Aggregated antibody pro-
teins in the Protein A Sepharose pool were removed by size
exclusion chromatography or binding ion exchange chroma-
tography on anion exchanger resin such as Q Sepharo se resin.
The specific IEX conditions for the 31H4 proteins are
Q-Sepharose HP at pH 7.8-8.0. Antibody was eluted with a
NaCI gradient of 10 mM-500 mM in 25 column volumes.

BIAcore Affinity Measurements
A BIAcore (surface plasmon resonance device, Biacore,
Inc. , Piscataway, N.J.) affinity analysis of the 21B12antibod-
ies to PCSK9 described in this Example was performed
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, the surface plasmon resonance experiments were
performed using Biacore 2000 optical biosensors (Biacore,
GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Each individual anti-
PCSK9 antibody was immobilized to a research-grade CM5
biosensor chip by amine-coupling at levels that gave a maxi-
mum analyte binding response (Rmax) of no more than 200
resonance units (RU). The concentration of PCSK9 protein
was varied at 2 fold intervals (the analyte) and was injected
over the immobilized antibody surface (at a flow rate of 100
pl/min for 1.5 minutes). Fresh HBS-P buffer (pH 7.4, 0.01 M
Hepes, 0.15 M NaCI, 0.005% surfactant P-20, Biacore)
supplemented with 0.01% BSA was used as binding buffer.
Binding affinities of each anti-PCSK9 antibody were mea-
sured in separate experiments against each of the human,
mouse, and cynomolgus monkey PCSK9 proteins at pH 7.4
(the concentrations used were 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125,
and 0 nM).
In addition, the binding affinities of antibody to human
PCSK9 were also measured at pH 6.0 with the pH 6.0 HBS-P
buffer (pH 6.0, 0.01 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCI, 0.005% surfac-
tant P-20, Biacore) supplemented with 0.01% BSA. The
binding signal obtained was proportional to the free PCSK9
in solution. The dissociation equilibrium constant (K~) was
obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the competi-
tion curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding
model (KinExA software, Sapidyne Instruments Inc. ,
Boise, Id.) (n=l for the 6.0 pH runs). Interestingly, the anti-
bodies appeared to display a tighter binding affinity at the
lower pH (where the Kd was 12.5, 73, and 29 pM for 31H4,
21B12,and 16F12 respectively).
Antibody binding kinetic parameters including k (asso-
ciation rate constant), k~ (dissociation rate constant), and K~
(dissociation equilibrium constant) were determined using
the BIA evaluation 3.1 computer program (BIAcore, Inc.
Piscataway, N.J.). Lower dissociation equilibrium constants
indicate greater affinity of the antibody for PCSK9. The K~
values determined by the BIAcore affinity analysis are pre-
sented in Table 7.1, shown below.

KinExA Affinity Measurements
A KinExA (Sapidyne Instruments, Inc. , Boise, Id.) affin-
ity analysis of 16F12 and 31H4 was performed according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Reacti-Gel™(6x)
(Pierce) was pre-coated with one of human, V5-tagged cyno
or His-tagged mouse PCSK9 proteins and blocked with BSA.
10 or 100pM of either antibody 16F12or antibody 31H4 and
one of the PCSK9 proteins was then incubated with various
concentrations (0.1 pM-25 nM) of PCSK9 proteins at room
temperature for 8 hours before being passed through the
PCSK9-coated beads. The amount of the bead-bound 16F12
or 31H4 was quantified by fluorescently (Cy5) labeled goat
anti-human IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson Immuno
Research). The binding signal is proportional to the concen-
tration of free 16F12 or 31H4 at binding equilibrium. Equi-
librium dissociation constant (K~) were obtained from non-
linear regression of the two sets of competition curves using
a one-site homogeneous binding model. The KinExA Pro
software was employed in the analysis. Binding curves gen-
erated in this analysis are presented as FIGS. 4A-4F.
Both the 16F12and 31H4 antibodies showed similar affin-
ity to human and cyno PCSK9, but approximately 10-250
fold lower affinity to mouse PCSK9. Of the two antibodies
tested using the KinExA system, antibody 31H4 showed
higher affinity to both human and cyno PCSK9 with 3 and 2
pM K~, respectively. 16F12 showed slightly weaker affinity
at 15p M K~ to human PCS K9 and 16p M K~ to cyno PCS K9.
The results of the KinExA affinity analysis are summa-
rized in Table 8.1, shown below.

P20. Binding of the free PCSK9 in the mixed solutions were
measured by injecting over the 21B12.1 antibody surface.
100% PCSK9 binding signal on 21B12.1 surface was deter-
mined in the absence of mAb in the solution. A decreased
PCSK9 binding response with increasing concentrations of
mAb indicated that PCSK9 binding to mAb in solution,
which blocked PCSK9 from binding to the immobilized pep-
tibody surface. Plotting the PCSK9 binding signal versus
mAb concentrations, K~ was calculated from three sets of
10
curves (03, I and 3 nM fixed PCSK9 concentration) using a
one-site homogeneous binding model in KinExA Pro™so ft-
ware. Although cPCSK9 has lower protein concentration
observed from KinExA assay and SDS-gel, its concentration
was not adjusted here since the concentration ofcPCSK9 was
16
not used for calculation of K~. The results are displayed in
Table 8.2 below and in FIGS. 5B-5D. FIG. 5B depicts the
results from the solution equilibrium assay at three different
hPCSK9 concentrations for hPCSK9. FIG. 5C depicts a simi-
lar set of results for mPCSK9. FIG. 5D depicts the results

Epitope Binning
Competition ELISA was used for anti-PCSK9 antibody
binning. Briefly, to determine if two antibodies belong to the
same epitope bin, one of the antibodies (mAbl) was first
coated onto an ELISA plate (NUNC) at 2 pg/ml by overnight
incubation. The plate was then washed and blocked with 3%
BSA. Meanwhile, 30 ng/ml of biotinylated hPCSK9 was
incubated with the second antibody (mAb2) for 2 hours at
room temperature. The mixture was applied to coated mAb I
and incubated for I hour at room temperature. The ELISA
plate was then washed and incubated with Neutravidin-HRP
(Pierce) at I:5000dilutions for I hour. After another wash, the
plate was incubated with TMB substrate and signal was
detected at 650 nm using a Titertek plate reader. Antibodies
with the same binding profiles were grouped together into the
same epitope bin. The results of the antibody binning studies
are presented in Table 83.

In addition, a SDS PAGE was run to check the quality and
quantity of the samples and is shown in FIG. 5A. cPCSK9
showed around 50% less on the gel and also from the active
binding concentration calculated from KinExA assay.
Therefore, the K~ of the mAbs to cPCSK9 was adjusted as
50% of the active cPCSK9 in the present.
A BIAcore solution equilibrium binding assay was used to
measure the Kd values forABP 21B12.21B12.1 showed little
signal using KinExA assay, therefore, biacore solution equi-
librium assay was applied. Since no significant binding was
observed on binding of antibodies to immobilized PCSK9
surface, 21B12 antibody was immobilized on the flow cell 4
of a CM5 chip using amine coupling with density around
7000 RU. Flow cell 3 was used as a background control. 03,
I, and 3 nM of human PCSK9 or cyno PCSK9 were mixed
with a serial dilutions of 21B12.1 antibody samples (ranged
from 0.001-25 nM) in PBS plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.005%

Additional examination of the epitope binning was per-
formed using BIAcore. Three mAbs, 16F12, 21B12 and
31H4, were immobilized on flow cells 2, 3 and 4 with density
around 8000 RU. 5 nM PCSK9 from human, mouse and cyno
were injected over the mAb surfaces to reach around 100 to
500 RU. 10 nM mAbs were then injected over the PCSK9
surface. Binding of three mAbs to three different PCSK9
proteins over the three mAbs were then recorded.
If the two mAbs had a similar epitope on the antigen, mAb
I will not show the binding to the antigen already bound to the
mAb 2. If the two mAbs have the different epitope on the
antigen, mAb I will show the binding to the antigen bound to
the mAb2. FIG. 5E depicts these epitope binning results in
graph form for three mAbs on human PCSk9. A similar
pattern was observed for mPCSK9 and cPCSK9.As shown in
the graph, 16F12and 31H4 appear to share a similar epitope,
while 21B12 appears to have a different epitope.

The antibodies also blocked the binding of wild-type
PCSK9 to the LDLR in this assay.

HepG2 cells were seeded in black, clear bottom 96-well
plates (Costar) at a concentration of Sx10 cells per well in
DMEM medium (Mediatech, Inc) supplemented with 10%
16
FBS and incubated at 37' C. (5%CO2) overnight. To form the
PCSK9 and antibody complex, 2 pg/ml of D374Y human
PCSK9 was incubated with various concentrations of anti-
body diluted in uptake buffer (DMEM with 1% FBS) or
uptake buffer alone (control) for I hour at room temperature.
After washing the cells with PBS, the D374Y PCSK9/anti-
body mixture was transferred to the cells, followed by LDL-
BODIPY (Invitrogen) diluted in uptake buffer at a final con-
centration of 6 pg/ml. After incubation for 3 hours at 37' C.
(5% CO2), cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and the
cell fluorescence signal was detected by Safire™(TECAN) at
480-520 nm (excitation) and 520-600 nm (emission).
The results of the cellular uptake assay are shown in FIGS.
7A-7D. Summarily, ICso values were determined for each
30 antibody and found to be I 6.7 nM for 31H4 IgG2 (FIG. 7A),
13.3 nM for 31H4 IgG4 (FIG. 7B), 13.3 nM for 21B12IgG2
(FIG. 7C), and 18 nM for 21B12 IgG4 (FIG. 7D). These
results demonstrate that the applied antigen binding proteins
can reduce the effect of PCSK9 (D374Y) to block LDL
update by cells The antibodies also blocked the effect of
wild-type PCSK9 in this assay.

Efficacy of 31H4 and 21B12 for Blocking D374Y
PCSK9/LDLR Binding
This example provides the IC50 values for two of the
antibodies in blocking PCSK9 D374Y's ability to bind to
LDLR. Clear 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2
micrograms/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&D
Systems) diluted in buffer A (100mM sodium cacodylate, pH
7.4). Plates were washed thoroughly with buffer A and then
blocked for 2 hours with buffer B (1%milk in buffer A). After
washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 micro-
grams/ml ofLDL receptor (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer C
(buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaC12). Concurrent
with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9
was incubated with various concentrations of the 31H4 IgG2,
31H4 IgG4, 21B12IgG2 or 21B12IgG4 antibody, which was
diluted in buffer A, or buffer A alone (control). The LDL
receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated
D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and
incubated for I hour at room temperature. Binding of the
biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by
incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml
inbufferC followedby TMB substrate (KPL). The signal was
quenched with IN HCI and the absorbance read at 450 nm.
The results of this binding study are shown in FIGS.

antibody and found to be 199 pM for 31H4 IgG2 (FIG. 6A),

In order to assess total serum cholesterol (TC) lowering in
wild type (WT) mice via antibody therapy against PCSK9
protein, the following procedure was performed.
Male WT mice (C57BL/6 strain, aged 9-10 weeks, 17-27
g) obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.) were
fed a normal chow (Harland-Teklad, Diet 2918) through out
the duration ofthe experiment. Mice were administered either
anti-PCSK9 antibody 31H4 (2 mg/ml in PBS) or control IgG
(2 mg/ml in PBS) at a level of 10 mg/kg through the mouse' s
tail vein at T=O. Na'ive mice were also set aside as a na'ive
control group. Dosing groups and time of sacrifice are shown
in Table 9.

Mice were sacrificed with CO2 asphyxiation at the pre-
determined time points shown in Table 9.Blood was collected
via vena cava into eppendorf tubes and was allowed to clot at
room temperature for 30 minutes. The samples were then
spun down in a table top centrifuge at 12,000xg for 10 min-
utes to separate the serum. Serum total cholesterol and
HDL-C were measured using Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer
and Roche/Hitachi TC and HDL-C kits.
The results of the experiment are shown in FIGS. SA-SD.
Summarily, mice to which antibody 31H4 was administered
showed decreased serum cholesterol levels over the course of
the experiment (FIG. SA and FIG. SB).In addition, it is noted
that the mice also showed decreased HDL levels (FIG. SC and
FIG. SD). For FIG. SA and FIG. SC, the percentage change is
in relation to the control IgG at the same time point (*P&0.01,
¹P&0.05).For FIG. SB and FIG. SD, the percentage change is
in relation to total serum cholesterol and HDL levels mea-
sured in na'ive animals at t=O hrs (*P&0.01, ¹P&0.05).
In respect to the lowered HDL levels, it is noted that one of
skill in the art will appreciate that the decrease in HDL in mice
is not indicative that an HDL decrease will occur in humans
and merely further reflects that the serum cholesterol level in
the organism has decreased. It is noted that mice transport the
majority of serum cholesterol in high density lipoprotein
(HDL) particles which is different to humans who carry most
serum cholesterol on LDL particles. In mice the measurement
of total serum cholesterol most closely resembles the level of
serum HDL-C. Mouse HDL contains apolipoprotein E
(apoE) which is a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR) and
allows it to be cleared by the LDLR. Thus, examining HDL is
an appropriate indicator for the present example, in mice
(with the understanding that a decrease in HDL is not
expected for humans). For example, human HDL, in contrast,
does not contain apoE and is not a ligand for the LDLR. As
PCSK9 antibodies increase LDLR expression in mouse, the
liver can clear more HDL and therefore lowers serum HDL-C
levels.

In order to assess total serum cholesterol (TC) lowering in
wild type (WT) mice via antibody therapy against PCSK9
protein in a 13 day study, the following procedure was per-
formed.
Male WT mice (C57BL/6 strain, aged 9-10 weeks, 17-27
g) obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.) were
fed a normal chow (Harland-Teklad, Diet 2918) through out
the duration ofthe experiment. Mice were administered either
anti-PCSK9 antibody 31H4 (2 mg/ml in PBS) or control IgG
(2 mg/ml in PBS) at a level of 10 mg/kg through the mouse' s
tail vein at T=O. Na'ive mice were also set aside as na'ive
control group.
Dosing groups and time of sacrifice are shown in Table 10.
Animals were sacrificed and livers were extracted and pre-
pared as in Example 13.
The present example demonstrates that an antigen binding
protein alters the level of LDLR in a subject, as predicted,
over time. A Western blot analysis was performed in order to
ascertain the effect ofantibody 31H4 on LDLR levels. 50-100
mg of liver tissue obtained from the sacrified mice described
in Example 13 was homogenized in 0.3 ml of RIPA buffer
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) containing complete pro-
tease inhibitor (Roche). The homogenate was incubated on
ice for 30 minutes and centrifuged to pellet cellular debris.
Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using
BioRad protein assay reagents (BioRad laboratories). 100 pg
of protein was denatured at 70' C. for 10 minutes and sepa-
rated on 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS gradient gel (Invitrogen). Pro-
teins were transferred to a 0.45 pm PVDF membrane (Invit-
rogen) and blocked in washing buffer (50 mM Tris PH7. 5,
150 mM NaCL, 2 mM CaCln and 0.05% Tween 20) contain-
ing 5% non-fat milk for I hour at room temperature. The blot
was then probed with goat anti-mouse LDLR antibody (R&D
system) I:2000 or anti-B IJ actin (sigma) I:2000 for I hour at
room temperature. The blot was washed briefly and incubated
with bovine anti-goat IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.) I:2000 or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Upstate) I:2000.
After a I hour incubation at room temperature, the blot was
washed thoroughly and immunoreactive bands were detected

When the 6 day experiment was extended to a 13 day study,
the same serum cholesterol lowering effect observed in the 6
day study was also observed in the 13 day study. More spe-

decrease in serum cholesterol on day 3, which gradually
returned to pre-dosing levels by day 13.FIG. 10A depicts the

As shown in FIG. 10C both 16F12 and 31H4 resulted in
significant and substantial decreases in total serum choles-
terol after just a single dose and provided benefits for over a
week (10 days or more). The results of the repeated 13 day
study were consistent with the results of the first 13 day study,
with a decrease in serum cholesterol levels of 26% on day 3
being observed. For FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, the percentage
change is in relation to the control IgG at the same time point
(*P&0.01).For FIG. 10C, the percentage change is in relation
to the control IgG at the same time point (*P&0.05).

Repeated Administration ofAntibodies Produce
Continued Benefits ofAntigen Binding Peptides
In order to verify that the results obtained in the Examples
above can be prolonged for further benefits with additional
doses, the Experiments in Examples 15 and 16 were repeated
with the dosing schedule depicted in FIG. 11A. The results
are displayed in FIG. 11B.As can be seen in the graph in FIG.
11B,while both sets of mice displayed a significant decrease
in total serum cholesterol because all of the mice received an
initial injection of the 31H4 antigen binding protein, the mice
that received additional injections ofthe 3 1H4 ABP displayed
a continued reduction in total serum cholesterol, while those
mice that only received the control injection eventually dis-
played an increase in their total serum cholesterol. For FIG.
11,the percentage change is in relation to the na'ive animals at
t=0 hours (*P&0.01, **P&0.001).
The results from this example demonstrate that, unlike
other cholesterol treatment methods, in which repeated appli-
cations lead to a reduction in efficacy because of biological
adjustments in the subject, the present approach does not
seem to suffer from this issue over the time period examined.
Moreover, this suggests that the return of total serum choles-
The HDL levels for the animals in Example 15 were also
examined. HDL levels decreased in the mice. More specifi-
cally, animals dosed at 10 mg/kg demonstrated a 33%
decrease in HDL levels on day 3, which gradually returned to
pre-dosing levels by day 13. FIG. 10B depicts the results of
the experiment. There was a decrease in HDL levels of 34%
on day 3. FIG. 10Bdepicts the results of the repeated 13 day
experiment.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the
antibodies will lower mouse HDL, this is not expected to
occur in humans because ofthe differences in HDL in humans
and other organisms (such as mice). Thus, the decrease in
mouse HDL is not indicative of a decrease in human HDL.

This example outlines methods for determining which resi-
dues in PCSK9 are involved in forming or part of the epitope
for the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein to PCSK9.
In order to determine the epitopes to which certain of the
ABPs of the present invention bind, the epitopes of the ABPs
can be mapped using synthetic peptides derived from the
specific PCSK9 peptide sequence.
A SPOTs peptide array (Sigma Genosys) can be used to
study the molecular interaction of the human anti-PCSK9
antibodies with their peptide epitope. SPOTs technology is
based on the solid-phase synthesis of peptides in a format
suitable for the systematic analysis of antibody epitopes.
Synthesis of custom arrayed oligopeptides is commerically
available from Sigma-Genosys. A peptide array of overlap-
ping oligopeptides derived from the amino-acid sequence of
the PCSK9 peptide can be obtained. The array can comprise
a series of 12-mer peptides as spots on a polypropylene mem-
brane sheets. The peptide array can span the entire length of
the PCSK9 mature sequence. Each consecutive peptide can
be offset by I residue from the previous one, yielding a
nested, overlapping library of arrayed oligopeptides. The
membrane carrying the peptides can be reacted with different
anti-PCSK9 antibodies (I micrograms/ml). The binding of
the mAbs to the membrane-bound peptides can be assessed
by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using HRP-con-
jugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemilu-
minescence (ECL).
In addition, functional epitopes can be mapped by combi-
natorial alanine scanning. In this process, a combinatorial
alanine-scanning strategy can be used to identify amino acids
in the PCSK9 protein that are necessary for interaction with
anti-PCSK9ABPs. To accomplishthis, a second set of SPOTs
arrays can be used for alanine scanning. A panel of variant
peptides with alanine substitutions in each of the 12 residues
can be scanned as above. This will allow for the epitopes for
the ABPs to the human PCSK9 to be mapped and identified.
In the alternative, given that it is possible that the epitope is
conformational, a combination of alanine scanning and/or
arginine scanning, antibody FAB/PCSK9 co-crystallization,
and limited proteolysis/LC-MS (liquid chromatography mass
spec. ) can be employed to indentify the epitopes.

A human patient exhibiting a Cholesterol Related Disorder
(in which a reduction in cholesterol (such as serum choles-
terol) can be beneficial) is administered a therapeutically
effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, 31H4 (or, for example,
21B12or 16F12).At periodic times during the treatment, the
patient is monitored to determine whether the symptoms of
the disorder has subsided. Following treatment, it is found
that patients undergoing treatment with the PCSK9 antibody
have reduced serum cholesterol levels, in comparison to
patients that are not treated.
terol or HDL cholesterol levels to baseline, observed in the
previous examples is not due to some resistance to the treat-
ment being developed by the subject, but rather the depletion
of the antibody availability in the subject.

the patient receiving the treatment with the PCSK9 antibodies
has reduced serum cholesterol levels in comparison to arthri-
tis patients not receiving the treatment.

A human patient at risk of developing coronary heart dis-

cally effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, such as 31H4 (or,
for example, 21B12or 16F12), either alone, concurrently or
sequentially with a statin, e.g. , simvastatin. At periodic times
during the treatment, the human patient is monitored to deter-
mine whether the patient's total serum cholesterol level
changes. Throughout the preventative treatment, it is found
that the patient receiving the treatment with the PCSK9 anti-
bodies has reduced serum cholesterol thereby reducing their
risk to coronary heart diseases or recurrent cardiovascular
events in comparison to patients not receiving the treatment.
Example 22
Use of PCSK9 Antibodies as a Diagnostic Agent
An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for
the detection of PCSK9 antigen in a sample can used to
diagnose patients exhibiting high levels of PCSK9 produc-
tion. In the assay, wells ofa microtiter plate, such as a 96-well
microtiter plate or a 384-well microtiter plate, are adsorbed
for several hours with a first fully human monoclonal anti-
body directed against PCSK9. The immobilized antibody
serves as a capture antibody for any of the PCSK9 that may be
present in a test sample. The wells are rinsed and treated with
a blocking agent such as milk protein or albumin to prevent
nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.
Subsequently the wells are treated with a test sample sus-
pected ofcontaining the PCSK9, or with a solution containing
a standard amount of the antigen. Such a sample may be, for
example, a serum sample from a subject suspected of having
levels of circulating antigen considered to be diagnostic of a
pathology.
After rinsing away the test sample or standard, the wells are
treated with a second fully human monoclonal PCSK9 anti-
body that is labeled by conjugation with biotin. A mono clonal
or mouse or other species origin can also be used. The labeled
PCSK9 antibody serves as a detecting antibody. After rinsing
away excess second antibody, the wells are treated with avi-
din-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a suitable
chromogenic substrate. The concentration of the antigen in
the test samples is determined by comparison with a standard
curve developed from the standard samples.

This ELISA assay provides a highly specific and very
sensitive assay for the detection ofthe PCSK9 antigen in a test
sample.
Determination of PCSK9 Protein Concentration in Subjects
A sandwich ELISA can quantify PCSK9 levels in human
serum. Two fully human monoclonal PCSK9 antibodies from
the sandwich ELISA, recognize different epitopes on the
PCSK9 molecule. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies of
mouse or other species origin may be used. The ELISA is
performed as follows: 50 pL of capture PCSK9 antibody in
coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.6) at a concentration of
2 pg/mL is coated on ELISA plates (Fisher). After incubation
at 4' C. overnight, the plates are treated with 200 pL of
blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.01% Thime-
rosal in PBS) for I hour at 25' C. The plates are washed (3x)
using 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (washing buffer, WB).Normal
or patient sera (Clinomics, Bioreclaimation) are diluted in
blocking buffer containing 50% human serum. The plates are
incubated with serum samples overnight at 4' C., washed
with WB, and then incubated with 100pL/well ofbiotinylated
detection PCSK9 antibody for I hour at 25' C.After washing,
the plates are incubated with HRP-Streptavidin for 15 min-
utes, washed as before, and then treated with 100 pL/well of
o-phenylenediamine in H~O~ (Sigma developing solution)
for color generation. The reaction is stopped with 50 pL/well
of H~SO4 (2M) and analyzed using an ELISA plate reader at
492 nm. Concentration ofPCSK9 antigen in serum samples is
calculated by comparison to dilutions of purified PCSK9
antigen using a four parameter curve fitting program.
Determination of PCSK9 Variant Protein Concentration in
Subjects
The steps outlined above can be performed using antibod-
ies noted hereinthat bind to both the wildtype PCSK9 andthe
variant PCSK9 (D374Y). Next, antibodies that bind to the
wild type but not the mutant can be used (again using a similar
protocol as outlined above) to determine ifthe PCSK9 present
in the subject is wild type or the D374Y variant. As will be
appreciated by one of skill in the art, results that are positive
for both rounds will be wild-type, while those that are positive
for the first round, but not the second round ofantibodies, will
include the D374Y mutation. There are high frequency muta-
tions in the population that are known and the could benefit
particularly from an agent such as the ABPs disclosed herein.
Example 23
Use of PCSK9 Antigen Binding Protein for the
Prevention of Hypercholesterolemia
A human patient exhibiting a risk ofdeveloping hypercho-
lesterolemia is identified via family history analysis and/or
lifestyle, and/or current cholesterol levels. The subject is
regularly administered (e.g. , one time weekly) a therapeuti-
cally effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, 31H4 (or, for
example, 21B12 or 16F12). At periodic times during the
treatment, the patient is monitored to determine whether
serum cholesterol levels have decreased. Following treat-
ment, it is found that subjects undergoing preventative treat-
ment with the PCSK9 antibody have lowered serum choles-
terol levels, in comparison to subjects that are not treated.
Example 24
PCSK9 ABPs Further Upregulated LDLR in the
Presence of Statins
This example demonstrates that ABPs to PCSK9 produced
further increases in LDLR availability when used in the pres-

ence of statins, demonstrating that further benefits can be
achieved by the combined use of the two.
HepG2 cells were seeded in DMEM with 10%fetal bovine
serum (FBS)and grown to -90% confluence. The cells were
treated with indicated amounts ofmevinolin (a statin, Sigma)
and PCSK9 ABPs (FIGS. 12A-12C) in DMEM with 3% FBS
for 48 hours. Total cell lysates were prepared. 50 mg of total
proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and trans-
ferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were performed
using rabbit anti-human LDL receptor antibody (Fitzgerald)
or rabbit anti-human b-actin antibody. The enhanced chemi-
luminescent results are shown in the top panels of FIGS.
12A-12C. The intensity of the bands were quantified by
Image J software and normalized by b-actin. The relative lev-
els of LDLR are shown in the lower panels of FIGS. 12A-
12C. ABPs 21B12 and 31H4 are PCSK9 neutralizing anti-
bodies, while 25A7. 1 is a non-neutralizing antibody.
HepG2-PCSK9 cells were also created. These were stable
HepG2 cell line transfected with human PCSK9. The cells
were seeded in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and grew to -90% confluence. The cells were treated with
indicated amounts of mevinolin (Sigma) and PCSK9 ABPs
(FIGS. 12D-12F) in DMEM with 3%FBS for 48 hours. Total
cell lysates were prepared. 50 mg of total proteins were sepa-
rated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF mem-
brane. Immunoblots were performed using rabbit anti-human
LDL receptor antibody (Fitzgerald) or rabbit anti-human
b-actin antibody. The enhanced chemiluminescent results are
shown in the top panels. The intensity of the bands were
quantified by Image J software and normalized by b-actin.
As can be seen in the results depicted in FIGS. 12A-12F,
increasing amounts of the neutralizing antibody and increas-
ing amounts of the statin generally resulted in increases in the
level of LDLR. This increase in effectiveness for increasing
levels of the ABP is especially evident in FIGS. 12D-12F, in
which the cells were also transfected with PCSK9, allowing
the ABPs to demonstrate their effectiveness to a greater
extent.
Interestingly, as demonstrated by the results in the com-
parison of FIGS. 12D-12F to 12A-12C, the influence of the
ABP concentrations on LDLR levels increased dramatically
when PCSK9 was being produced by the cells. In addition, it
is clear that the neutralizing ABPs (21B12and 31H4) resulted
in a greater increase in LDLR levels, even in the presence of
statins, than the 25A7. 1 ABP (a non-neutralizer), demonstrat-
ing that additional benefits can be achieved by the use ofboth
statins and ABPs to PCSK9.
Example 25
Consensus Sequences
Consensus sequences were determined using standard
phylogenic analyses of the CDRs corresponding to the V~
and Vz of anti-PCSK9 ABPs. The consensus sequences were
determined by keeping the CDRs contiguous within the same
sequence corresponding to a V~ or Vz. Briefly, amino acid
sequences corresponding to the entire variable domains of
either V~ or Vz were converted to FASTA formatting for ease
in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylog-
enies. Next, framework regions of these sequences were
replaced with an artificial linker sequence ("bbbbbbbbbb"
placeholders, non-specific nucleic acid construct) so that
examination of the CDRs alone could be performed without
introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to
coincident events (e.g. , such as unrelated antibodies that ser-
endipitously share a common germline framework heritage)

while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same
sequence corresponding to a V~ or Vz. V~ or Vz sequences of
this format were then subjected to sequence similarity align-
ment interrogation using a program that employs a standard
ClutalW-like algorithm (see, Thompson et al. , 1994, Nucleic
Acids Res. 22:4673-4680).A gap creation penalty of 8.0 was
employed along with a gap extension penalty of 2.0. This
program likewise generated phylograms (phylogenic tree
illustrations) based on sequence similarity alignments using
either UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arith-
metic averages) or Neighbor-Joining methods (see, Saitou
and Nei, 1987, Molecular Biology and Evolution 4:406-425)
to construct and illustrate similarity and distinction of
sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping.
Both methods produced similar results but UPGMA-derived
trees were ultimately used as the method employs a simpler
and more conservative set of assumptions. UPGMA-derived
trees were generated where similar groups of sequences were
defined as having fewer than 15 substitutions per 100residues
(see, legend in tree illustrations for scale) amongst individual
sequences within the group and were used to define consen-
sus sequence collections. The results of the comparisons are
depicted in FIGS. 13A-13J. In FIG. 13E, the groups were
chosen so that sequences in the light chain that clade are also
a Glade in the heavy chain and have fewer than 15 substitu-
tions.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results
presented in FIGS. 13A-13J present a large amount of guid-
ance as to the importance of particular amino acids (for
example, those amino acids that are conserved) and which
amino acid positions can likely be altered (for example, those
positions that have different amino acids for different ABPs).
Example 26
Mouse Model for PCSK9 and ABP Ability to Lower
LDL In Vivo
To generate mice which over-expressed human PCSK9,
three week old WT C57BI/6 mice were injected via tail vein
administration with various concentrations of adenoassoci-
ated virus (AAV), recombinantly modified to express human
PCSK9, to determine the correct titer which would provide a
measurable increase of LDL-cholesterol in the mice. Using
this particular virus that expressed human PCSK9, it was
determined that 4.5xlOE12 pfu of virus would result in an
LDL-cholesterol level of approximately 40 mg/dL in circu-
lating blood (normal levels ofLDL in a WT mice are approxi-
mately 10mg/dL). The human PCSK9 levels in these animals
was found to be approximately 13 ug/mL. A colony of mice
were generated using this injection criteria.
One week after injection, mice were assessed for LDL-
cholesterol levels, and randomized into different treatment
groups. Animals were then administered, via tail vein injec-
tion, a single bolus injection of either 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg
of 16F12, 21B12, or 31H4 antigen binding proteins. IgG2
ABP was administered in a separate group of animals as a
dosing control. Subgroups of animals (n=6-7) were then
euthanized at 24 and 48 hours after ABP administration.
There were no effects on LDL-cholesterol levels following
IgG2 administration at either dose. Both 31H4 and 21B12
demonstrated significant LDL-cholesterol lowering up to and
including 48 hours post-administration, as compared to IgG2
control (shown in FIGS. 14A and 14Bat two different doses).
16F12 shows an intermediary LDL-cholesterol lowering
response, with levels returning to baseline of approximately
40 mg/dL by the 48 hour time point. This data is consistent
99
US 8,829,165 B2
100
with in vitro binding data (Biacore and Kinexa), which shows
near equivalent binding affinity between 31H4 and 21B12,
and a lesser affinity of 16F12 to human PCSK9.
As can be seen in the results, total cholesterol and HDL-
cholesterol were reduced by the PCSK9 ABPs in the model
(both total and HDL-C are elevated above WT mice due to the
overexpression of PCSK9). While cholesterol lowering in
this model appears to occur over a relatively short period of
time, this is believed to be due to the levels ofhuman PCSK9
that are present, which are supraphysiologically high in this
model. In addition, given that the expression is governed by
AAV, there is no regulation of PCSK9 expression. In these
figures, (*)denotes a P&0.05, and (**)denotes a P&0.005 as
compared to LDL-cholesterol levels observed in IgG2 control
injected animals at the same time point. The 13microgram/ml
level of serum human PCSK9 in the mice corresponds to an
approximately 520-fold increase above the endogenous
mouse PCSK9 levels (-25 ng/ml), and an approximately
75-fold increase above average human serum levels (-175
ng/ml). Thus, the antigen binding proteins should be even
more effective in humans.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the above
results demonstrate that appropriateness of the mouse model
for testing the antigen binding protein's ability to alter serum
cholesterol in a subject. One of skill in the art will also
recognize that the use of mouse HDL to monitor serum cho-
lesterol levels in a mouse, while useful for monitoring mouse
serum cholesterol levels, is not indicative of the ABPs impact
on human HDL in humans. For example, Cohen et al. ("Se-
quence variations in PCSK9, low LDL, and protection against
coronary heart disease", N Engl I Med, 354:1264-1272,
2006) demonstrated the lack of any effect of the PCSK9
loss-of-function mutations on human HDL levels (the
entirety of which is incorporated by reference). Thus, one of
skill in the art will appreciate that the ability of the ABP to
lower mouse HDL (which lack LDL) is not indicative of the
ABP's ability to lower human HDL. Indeed, as shown by
Cohen, this is unlikely to occur for neutralizing antibodies in
humans.
Example 27
31H4 and 21B12Bind to the ProCat Region of
PCSK9
The present example describes one method for determin-
ing where various antibodies bind to PCSK9.
The ProCat (31-449 of SEQ ID NO: 3) or V domain (450-
692 of SEQ ID NO: 3) of the PCSK9 protein was combined
with either antibody 31H4 or 21B12.The samples were ana-
lyzed by Native PAGE for complex formation. As can be seen
in FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B, gel shifts were present for the
Pro Cat/3 1H4 and Pro Cat/21B12 samples, demonstrating that
the antibodies bound to the ProCat domain.
Example 28
The LDLR EGFa Domain Binds to the Catalytic
Domain of PCSK9
The present example presents the solved crystal structure
of PCSK9 ProCat (31-454 of SEQ ID NO: 3) bound to the
LDLR EGFa domain (293-334) at 2.9 A. resolution (the con-
ditions for which are described in the below Examples).
A representation ofthe structure ofPCS K9 bound to EGFa
is shown in FIG. 17.The crystal structure (and its depiction in
FIG. 17) reveals that the EGFa domain of LDLR binds to the

catalytic domain of PCSK9. In addition, the interaction of
PCSK9 and EGFa appears to occur across a surface ofPCSK9
that is between residues D374 and S153 in the structure
depicted in FIG. 17.
Specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues ofthe interaction
interface with the LDLR EGFa domain were defined as
PCSK9 residues that are within 5 A. of the EGFa domain. The
core residues are as follows: S153, I154, P155, R194, D238,
A239, I369, S372, D374, C375, T377, C378, F379, V380,
and S381.
Boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction
interface with the LDLR EGFa domain were defined as
PCSK9 residues that are 5-8 A. from the EGFa domain. The
boundary residues are as follows: W156, N157, L158, E159,
H193, E195, H229, R237, G240, K243, D367, I368, G370,
A371, S373, S376, and Q382. Residues that are underlined
are nearly or completely buried within PCSK9.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results
from this example demonstrate where PCSK9 and EGFa
interact. Thus, antibodies that interact with or block any of
these residues can be useful as antibodies that inhibit the
interaction between PCSK9 and the EGFa domain of LDLR
(and/or LDLR generally). In some embodiments, antibodies
that, when bound to PCSK9, interact with or block any of the
above residues or are within 15-8, 8, 8-5, or 5 angstroms ofthe
above residues are contemplated to provide useful inhibition
of PCSK9 binding to LDLR.
Example 29
31H4 Interacts with Amino Acid Residues from Both
the Pro- and Catalytic Domains of PCSK9
The present example presents the crystal structure of full
length PCSK9 (N533A mutant of SEQ ID NO: 3) bound to
the Fab fragment of31H4, determined to 2.3 A. resolution (the
conditions for which are described in the below Examples).
This structure, depicted in FIGS. 1SA and 1SB, shows that
31H4 binds to PCSK9 in the region of the catalytic site and
makes contacts with amino acid residues from both the pro-
domain and catalytic domain.
The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific
core PCSK9 amino acid residues for the interaction interface
of 31H4 with PCSK9. This was defined as residues that are
within 5 A. of the 31H4 protein. The core residues are as
follows: W72, F150,A151, Q152, T214, R215, F216, H217,
A220, S221, K222, S225, H226, C255, Q256, G257, K258,
N317, F318, T347, L348, G349, T350, L351, E366, D367,
D374, V380, S381, Q382, S383, and G384.
The structures were also used to identify boundary PCSK9
amino acid residues for the interaction interface with 31H4.
These residues were PCSK9 residues that were 5-8 A. from
the 31H4 protein. The boundary residues are as follows: K69,
D70, P71, S148, V149, D186, T187, E211, D212, G213,
R218, Q219, C223, D224, G227, H229, L253, N254, G259,
P288, A290, G291, G316, R319,Y325, V346, G352, T353,
G365, I368, I369, S372, S373, C378, F379, T385, S386, and
Q387. Amino acid residues completely buried within the
PCSK9 protein are underlined.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, FIG. 1SB
depicts the interaction between the CDRs on the antigen
binding protein and PCSK9.As such, the model allows one of
skill in the art to identify the residues and/or CDRs that are
especially important in the paratope, and which residues are
less critical to the paratope. As can be seen in FIG. 1SB, the
heavy chain CDRI, CDR2, and CDR3 are most directly
involved in the antigen binding protein's binding to the
101
US 8,829,165 B2
102
epitope, with the CDRs from the light chain being relatively
far away from the epitope. As such, it is probable that larger
variations in the light chain CDRs are possible, without
unduly interfering with the binding of the antigen binding
protein to PCSK9. In some embodiments, residues in the
structures that directly interact are conserved (or alternatively
conservatively replaced) while residues that are not directly
interacting with one another can be altered to a greater extent.
As such, one of skill in the art, given the present teachings, can
predict which residues and areas of the antigen binding pro-
teins can be varied without unduly interfering with the anti-
gen binding protein's ability to bind to PCSK9. For example,
those residues that are located closest to PCSK9 when the
antigen binding protein is bound to PCSK9 are those that
likely play a more important role in the binding of the antigen
binding protein to PCSK9. As above, these residues can be
divided into those that are within 5 angstroms of PCSK9 and
those that are between 5 and 8 angstroms. Specific core 31H4
amino acid residues of the interaction interface with PCSK9
were defined as 31H4 residues that are within 5 A. of the
PCSK9 protein. For the heavy chain, the residues that are
within 5 angstroms include the following: T28, S30, S31,
Y32, S54, S55, S56, Y57, I58, S59, Y60, N74, A75, R98,
Y100, F102, W103, S104, A105, Y106,Y107, D108, A109,
and Dl I l. For the light chain, those residues that are within 5
angstroms include the following: L48, S51,Y93, and S98.For
the heavy chain, those residues that are 5-8 A. from the PCSK9
protein include the following: G26, F27, F29, W47, S50, I51,
S52, S53, K65, F68, T69, I70, S71, R72, D73, K76, N77,
D99, D101, F110, and V112. For the light chain, those resi-
dues that are within 5-8 angstroms of PCSK9 include A31,
G32, Y33, D34, H36, Y38, I50, G52, N55, R56, P57, S58,
D94, S95, S96, L97, G99, and S100.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results
from Example 29 demonstrate where antibodies to PCSK9
can interact on PCSK9 and still block PCSK9 from interact-
ing with EGFa (and thus LDLR). Thus, antigen binding pro-
teins that interact with any of these PCSK9 residues, or that
block any of these residues (e.g. , from other antigen binding
proteins that bind to these residues), can be useful as antibod-
ies that inhibit the interaction of PCSK9 and EGFa (and
LDLR accordingly). Thus, in some embodiments, antigen
binding proteins that interact with any ofthe above residues or
interact with residues that are within 5 A. of the above residues
are contemplated to provide useful inhibition PCSK9 binding
to LDLR. Similarly, antigen binding proteins that block any
of the above residues (which can be determined, for example,
via a competition assay) can also be useful for inhibition of
the PCSK9/LDLR interaction.
Example 30
21B12Binds to the Catalytic Domain of PCSK9, has
a Distinct Binding Site from 31H4 and can Bind to
PCSK9 Simultaneously with 31H4
The present example presents the crystal structure of
PCSK9 ProCat (31-449 of SEQ ID NO: 3) bound to the Fab
fragments of31H4 and 21B12,determined at 2.8 A. resolution
(the conditions for which are described in the below
Examples). This crystal structure, depicted in FIG. 19A and
FIG. 19B, shows that 31H4 and 21B12have distinct binding
sites on PCSK9 and that both antigen binding proteins can
bind to PCSK9 simultaneously. The structure shows that
21B12 interacts with amino acid residues from PCSK9's
catalytic domain. In this structure, the interaction between
PCSK9 and 31H4 is similar to what was observed above.

Specific core PCSK9 amino acid residues ofthe interaction
interface with 21B12were defined as PCSK9 residues that are
within 5 A. of the 21B12 protein. The core residues are as
follows: S153, S188, I189, Q190, S191,D192, R194, E197,
G198, R199, V200, D224, R237, D238, K243, S373, D374,
S376, T377, and F379.
Boundary PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction
interface with 21B12 were defined as PCSK9 residues that
were 5-8 A. from the 21B12protein. The boundary residues
are as follows: I154, T187, H193, E195, I196, M201, V202,
C223, T228, S235, G236, A239, G244, M247, I369, S372,
C375, and C378. Amino acid residues nearly or completely
buried within the PCSK9 protein are underlined.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, FIG. 19B
depicts the interaction between the CDRs on the antigen
binding protein and PCSK9.As such, the model allows one of
skill in the art to identify the residues and/or CDRs which are
especially important for the paratope and which residues are
less critical to the paratope. As can be seen in the structure,
heavy chain CDR2 and light chain CDRI appear to closely
interact with the epitope. Next, heavy chain CDRI, heavy
chain CDR3 and light chain CDR3, appear to be close to the
epitope, but not as close as the first set ofCDRs. Finally, light
chain CDR2 appears to be some distance from the epitope. As
such, it is probable that larger variations in the more distant
CDRs are possible without unduly interfering with the bind-
ing ofthe antigen binding protein to PCSK9. In some embodi-
ments, residues in the structures that directly interact are
conserved (or alternatively conservatively replaced) while
residues that are not directly interacting with one another can
be altered to a greater extent. As such, one of skill in the art,
given the present teachings, can predict which residues and
areas of the antigen binding proteins can be varied without
unduly interfering with the antigen binding protein's ability
to bind to PCSK9. For example, those residues that are
located closest to PCSK9 when the antigen binding protein is
bound to PCSK9 are those that likely play a more important
role in the binding of the antigen binding protein to PCSK9.
As above, these residues can be divided into those that are
within 5 angstroms of PCSK9 and those that are between 5
and 8 angstroms. Specific core 21B12amino acid residues of
the interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined as 21B12
residues that are within 5 A. of the PCSK9 protein. For the
heavy chain, the residues that are within 5 angstroms include
the following: T30, S31,Y32, G33, W50, S52, F53,Y54, N55,
N57, N59, R98, G99, Y100, and G101. For the light chain,
those residues that are within 5 angstroms include the follow-
ing: G30, G31,Y32, N33, S34, E52, Y93, T94, S95, T96, and
S97. For the heavy chain, those residues that are 5-8 A. from
the PCSK9 protein include the following: T28, L29, I34, S35,
W47, V51, G56, T58, Y60, T72, M102, and D103. For the
light chain, those residues that are within 5-8 angstroms of
PCSK9 include the following: S26, V29, V35,Y51,N55, S92,
M98, and V99.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results
from Example 30 demonstrate where antigen binding pro-
teins to PCSK9 can interact on PCSK9 and still block PCSK9
from interacting with EGFa (and thus LDLR). Thus, antigen
binding proteins that interact with any of these PCSK9 resi-
dues or that block any of these residues can be useful as
antibodies that inhibit the interaction of PCSK9 and EGFa
(and LDLR accordingly). Thus, in some embodiments, anti-
bodies that interact with any of the above residues or interact
with residues that are within 5 A. of the above residues are
contemplated to provide useful inhibition PCSK9 binding to
LDLR. Similarly, antigen binding proteins that block any of

Example 31
Interaction Between EGFa, PCSK9, and the
Antibodies
The structure of the ternary complex (PCSK9/31H4/
21B12)from the above example was overlaid on the PCSK9/
EGFa structure (determined as described in Example 28) and
the result of this combination is depicted in FIG. 20A. This
figure demonstrates areas on PCSK9 which can be usefully
targeted to inhibit PCSK9 interaction with EGFa. The figure
shows that both 31H4 and 21B12 partially overlap with the
position ofthe EGFa domain ofLDLR and sterically interfere
with its binding to PCSK9. In addition, as can be seen in the
structures, 21B12 directly interacts with a subset of amino
acid residues that are specifically involved in binding to the
LDLR EGFa domain.
As noted above, analysis of the crystal structures identified
specific amino acids involved in the interaction between
PCSK9 and the partner proteins (the core and boundary
regions of the interface on the PCSK9 surface) and the spatial
requirements of these partner proteins to interact with
PCSK9. The structures suggest ways to inhibit the interaction
between PCSK9 and the LDLR. First, as noted above, bind-
ing an agent to PCSK9 where it shares residues in common
with the binding site of the EGFa domain of the LDLR would
inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR. Sec-
ond, an agent that binds outside of the residues in common
can sterically interfere with the EGFa domain or regions of
the LDLR that are either N- or C-terminal to the EGFa
domain to prevent the interaction between PCSK9 and the
LDLR.
In some embodiments, the residues that are involved in
both EGFa binding and are close to the areas where the above
noted antigen binding proteins bind are especially useful for
manipulating PCSK9 binding to LDLR. For example, amino
acid residues from interfaces in common in both the core
region and boundary region for the different binding partners
are listed in Table 12 below. Amino acid residues completely
buried within the PCSK9 protein are underlined.

ProCat (31-454 of SEQ ID NO: 3)/EGFa complex structure.
The structure of full length PCSK9' (Piper, D. E. et al. The
crystal structure of PCSK9: a regulator of plasma LDL-cho-
lesterol. Structure 15, 545-52 (2007)) was overlaid onto the
PCSK9 ProCat 31-454 from the complex and the structure of
the LDLR in its low pH conformation (Rudenko, G. et al.
Structure of the LDL receptor extracellular domain at endo-
somal p H. Science 298, 2353-8 (2002)) was overlaid onto the
EGFa domain from the complex. Depictions of the model are
shown in FIGS. 20B and 20C. The EGFa domain is indicated
by the box in the figure. The figures show regions of the
LDLR outside ofthe immediate EGFa binding domain that lie
in close proximity to PCSK9. FIGS. 20D-20F show the above
interaction, along with mesh surface representations of anti-
body 31H4 and 21B12from three different angles. As is clear
from the depictions, not only can the antibody interact and/or
interfere with LDLR's interaction with PCSK9 at the actual
binding site, but other steric interactions appear to occur as
well.
In light of the above results, it is clear that antigen binding
proteins that bind to PCSK9 can also inhibit the interaction
between PCSK9 and the LDLR by clashing with various
regions of the LDLR (not just the site at which LDLR and
PCSK9 interact). For example, it can clash with repeat 7 (R7),
the EGFb domain, and/or the II-propeller domain.
Embodiments ofAntigen Binding Molecules that Bind to or
Block EGFa Interaction with PCSK9
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, Examples
28-32, and their accompanying figures, provide a detailed
description of how and where EGFa interacts with PCSK9
and how two representative neutralizing antigen binding pro-
teins, 21B12 and 31H4 interact with PCSK9 and produce
their neutralizing effect. As such, one of skill in the art will
readily be able to identify antigen binding molecules that can
similarly reduce the binding between EGFa (including
LDLR) and PCSK9 by identifying other antigen binding mol-
ecules that bind at or near at least one of the same locations on
PCSK9. While the relevant locations (or epitopes) on PCSK9
are identified in the figures and the present description, it can
also be advantageous to describe these sites as being within a
set distance from residues that have been identified as close to
the EGFa binding site. In some embodiments, an antigen
binding molecule will bind to or within 30 angstroms of one
or more of the following residues (numbering in reference to
SEQ ID NO: 3):S153, I154, P155, R194, D238, A239, I369,

In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds
within 30, 30-25, 25-20, 20-15, 15-8,8,8-5,5,5-4, 4 or less
angstroms from one or more of the above residues. In some
embodiments, the antigen binding molecule, when bound to
PCSK9, is within at least one of the above distances, for more
than one of the above noted residues. For example, in some
embodiments, the antigen binding molecule is within one of
the recited distances (e.g. , 30, 30-25, 25-20, 20-15, 15-8,8,8-
5,5,5-4, 4orless) foratleast2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45,
45-50, 50-55, 55-60, 60-65, 65-70, 70-75 or more of the
above residues. In some embodiments, the antigen binding
molecule is within one of the recited distances for at least
1-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90,
90-95, 95-99, 99-100% of the residues identified in each
group of subgroup thereof (such as only those surface resi-
dues in the group). Unless specifically stated otherwise, the
distance between the antigen binding molecule and PCSK9 is
the shortest distance between the covalently bonded atom on
PCSK9 and the covalently bonded atom of the antigen bind-
ing molecule that are the closest atoms of PCSK9 and the
antigen binding molecule. Similarly, unless specifically
stated otherwise, the distance between a residue (on the anti-
gen binding molecule or PCSK9) and another protein (either
PCSK9 or the antigen binding molecule respectively), is the
distance from the closest point on the identified residue to the
closest covalently bonded part of the other protein. In some
embodiments, the distance can be measured from the back-
bone of the amino acid chains. In some embodiments, the
distance can be measured between an edge of the paratope
and an edge (closest to one another) of the epitope. In some
embodiments, the distance can be measured between the cen-
ter of the surface of the paratope and the center of the surface
of the epitope. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art,
the present description is applicable for each of the individual
sets of residues listed herein. For example, the above ranges
are contemplated generally and specifically for the 8 ang-
strom residues listed in Examples 28-32 and the 5 angstrom
residues listed in Examples 28-32.
In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds
to a surface on PCSK9 that is bound by at least one of EGFa,
21B12,or 31H4. In some embodiments, the antigen binding
molecule binds to PCSK9 at a location that overlaps with the
interaction locations between PCSK9 and EFGa, Ab 31H4,
and/or Ab 21B12 (as described in the above examples and
figures). In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule
binds to PCSK9 at a position that is further away from one of
the above recited residues. In some embodiments, such an
antigen binding molecule can still be an effective neutralizing
antigen binding molecule.

In some embodiments, the structure of the catalytic domain
of PCSK9 can be described as generally being triangular (as
shown in FIG. 19A). The first side of the triangle is shown as
being bound by 31H4. The second side of the triangle is
shown as being bound by 21B12, and the third side of the
triangle is positioned toward the bottom of the page, imme-
diately above the "FIG. 19A" label. In some embodiments,
antigen binding molecules that bind to the first and/or second
sides of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 can be useful as
neutralizing antibodies as they can either directly or sterically
interfere with EGFa's binding to PCSK9. As will be appre-
ciated by one of skill in the art, when the antigen binding
molecules are large enough, such as a full antibody, the anti-
gen binding molecule need not directly bind to the EGFa
binding site in order to interfere with the binding of EGFa to
PCSK9.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the
EGFa domain of the LDLR has been used in many of the
examples, the models and structures are still applicable to
how the full length LDLR protein will interact with PCSK9.
Indeed, the additional structure present on the full length
LDLR protein presents additional protein space that can fur-
ther be blocked by one of the antigen binding molecules. As
such, if the antigen binding molecule blocks or inhibits bind-
ing ofEGFa to PCSK9, it will likely be at least as, ifnot more,
effective with the full length LDLR protein. Similarly, anti-
gen binding molecules that are within a set distance or block
various residues that are relevant for inhibiting EGFa binding,
will likely be as effective, if not more effective, for the full
length LDLR.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, any mol-
ecule that blocks or binds to the above noted PCSK9 residues
(or within the recited distances), or that inhibits one or more
of the interactions noted in the above examples and figures,
can be used to inhibit the interaction of EGFa (or LDLR
generally) and PCSK9. As such, the molecule need not be
limited to an antigen binding "protein, "as any antigen bind-
ing molecule can also serve the required purpose. Examples
ofantigen binding molecules include aptamers, which can be
either oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules. Other
examples ofantigen binding molecules include avimers, pep-
tibodies, small molecules and polymers, and modified ver-
sions of EGFa that can increase its affinity to PCSK9 and/or
half-life, such as mutation of amino acids, glycosylation,
pegylation, Fc fusions, and avimer fusions. As will be appre-
ciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments LDLR
is not an antigen binding molecule. In some embodiments,
binding subsections of LDLR are not antigen binding mol-
ecules, e.g. , EGFa. In some embodiments, other molecules
through which PCSK9 signals in vivo are not antigen binding
molecules. Such embodiments will be explicitly identified as
such.
Example 33
Expression and Purification of Protein Samples
The present example describes some embodiments for how
the various embodiments of the PCSK9 proteins/variants
were made and purified (including the LDLR EGFa domain).
PCSK9 proteins/variants (e.g. , PSCK9 31-692 N533A,
PCSK9 449TEV and PCSK9 ProCat 31-454) were expressed
in baculovirus infected Hi-5 insect cells with an ¹erminal
honeybee melittin signal peptide followed by a His6 tag. The
PCSK9 proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatog-
raphy, ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion
chromatography. The melittin-His6 tag was removed during
107
US 8,829,165 B2
108
purification by cleavage with TEV protease. The construct
PCSK9 449TEV was used to generate PCSK9 ProCat (31-
449) and V domain (450-692) samples. This construct had a
TEV protease cleavage site inserted between PCSK9 residues
449 and 450. For the full length N555A variant for crystal-
lography, the PCSK9 31-454 fragment, and the PCSK9
449TEV variant for crystalography, the post rTEV protein
product also included an initial GAMG sequence. Thus, post
rTEV cleavage, these proteins were GAMG-PCSK9. Further-
more, the PCSK9 449TEV protein included the sequence
"ENLYFQ" (SEQ ID NO: 403) inserted between positions
H449 and G450 of SEQ ID NO: 3.After cleavage with rTEV,
the PCSK9 ProCat protein generated from this construct was
GAMG-PCSK9 (31-449)-ENLYFQ and the V domain gen-
erated from this construct was PCSK9 (450-692) of SEQ ID
NO: 3.
The 21B12 and 31H4Fab fragments were expressed in E.
coli. These proteins were purified by nickel affinity chroma-
tography, size exclusion chromatography and ion exchange
chromatography.
The LDLR EGFa domain (293-334) was expressed as a
GST fusion protein in E. coli. The EGFa domain was purified
by ion exchange chromatography, glutathione sepharose
affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography.
The GST protein was removed during the purification by
cleavage with PreScission protease.
Example 34
Complex Formation and Crystallization
The present example describes how complexes and crys-
tals used in the above structure examination Examples were
made.
The PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4 complex was made by
mixing a 1.5 molar excess of the 31H4Fab with PCSK9. The
complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography to
remove excess 31H4Fab. The PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4
complex crystallizes in 0.1 M Tris pH 83, 0.2 M sodium
acetate, 15% PEG 4000, 6% dextran sulfate sodium salt (Mr
5000).
The PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/21B12 complex was
made by first mixing a 1.5 molar excess of 31H4Fab with
PCSK9 31-449. The complex was separated from excess
31H4 by purification on a size exclusion chromatography
column. A 1.5 molar excess of 21B12Fab was then added to
the PCSK9 31-449/31H4 complex. The ternary complex was
separated from excess 21B12by purification on a size exclu-
sion chromatography column. The PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/
31H4/21B12 complex crystallizes in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 0.2 M
ammonium phosphate monobasic, 50% MPD.
The PCSK9 ProCat 31-454/EGFa complex was made by
mixing a 1.2 molar excess of EGFa domain with PCSK9
31-454. The PCSK9 ProCat 31-454/EGFa domain complex
crystallizes in 0.2 M potassium formate, 20% PEG 3350.

Initial datasets for the PCSK9 31-692 N533A/31H4 and
PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/21B12 crystals were collected
on a Rigaku FR-E X-ray source. The PCSK9 ProCat 31-454/

31-692 N533A/31H4 and PCSK9 ProCat 31-449/31H4/
21B12 crystals were collected at the Berkeley Advanced
Light Source beamline 5.0.2. All datasets were processed
with denzo/scalepack or HKL2000 (Otwinowski, Z. , Borek,
D., Majewski, W. & Minor, W. Multiparametric scaling of
diffraction intensities. Acta Crystallo g r A 59, 228-34 (2003)).
PCSK9/31H4 crystals grew in the C2 space group with unit
cell dimensions a=264.9, b=137.4, c=69.9 A., 13=102.8' and
diffract to 23 A. resolution. The PCSK9/31H4 structure was
solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP
(The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography. Acta
Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50, 760-3 (1994) using the
PCSK9 structure (Piper, D. E. et al. The crystal structure of
PCSK9: a regulator ofplasma LDL-cholesterol. Structure 15,
545-52 (2007)) as the starting search model. Keeping the
PCSK9 31-692 solution fixed, an antibody variable domain
was used as a search model. Keeping the PCSK9 31-692/
antibody variable domain solution fixed, an antibody constant
domain was used as a search model. The complete structure
was improved with multiple rounds of model building with
Quanta and refinement with cnx. (Brunger, A. T. et al. Crys-
tallography & NMR system: A new software suite for mac-
romolecular structure determination. Acta Crystallogr D Biol
Crystallogr 54, 905-21 (1998)).
PCSK9/31H4/21B12 crystals grew in the P2», 2 space
group with unit cell dimensions a=138.7, b=246.2, c=513 A.
and diffract to 2.8 A. resolution. The PCSK9/31H4/21B12
structure was solved by molecular replacement with the pro-
gram MOLREP using the PCSK9 ProCat/31H4 variable
domain as the starting search model. Keeping the PCSK9
ProCat/31H4 variable domain fixed, a search for antibody
constant domain was performed. Keeping the PC SK9 Pro Cat/
31H4/21B12 constant domain fixed, an antibody variable
domain was used as a search model. The complete structure
was improved with multiple rounds of model building with
Quanta and refinement with cnx.
PCSK9/EGFa domain crystals grew in the space group
P6s22 with unit cell dimensions a=b=70. 6, c=321.8 A. and
diffract to 2.9 A. resolution. The PCSK9/EGFa domain struc-
ture was solved by molecular replacement with the program
MOLREP using the PCSK9 ProCat as the starting search
model. Analysis of the electron density maps showed clear
electron density for the EGFa domain. The LDLR EGFa
domain was fit by hand and the model was improved with
multiple rounds of model building with Quanta and refine-
ment with cnx.
Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as
being all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than
or equal to 5 A. from the PCSK9 partner protein. 5 A. was
chosen as the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms
within a van der Waals radius plus a possible water-mediated
hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids
were determined as all amino acid residues with at least one
atom less than or equal to 8 A. from the PCSK9 partner protein
but not included in the core interaction list. Less than or equal
to 8 A. was chosen as the boundary region cutoff distance to
allow for the length of an extended arginine amino acid.
Amino acids that met these distance criteria were calculated
with the program PyMOL. (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System. (Palo Alto, 2002)).

Expression and Purification of Protein Samples
PCSK9 449TEV (a PCSK9 construct with a TEV protease
cleavage site inserted between residue 449 and 450, number-
ing according to SEQ ID NO: 3)was expressed in baculovirus
infected Hi-5 insect cells with an ¹erminal honeybee melit-
tin signal peptide followed by a His~ tag. The PCSK9 protein
was purified by first by nickel affinity chromatography. TEV
protease was used to remove the melittin-His~ tag and cleave
the PCSK9 protein between the catalytic domain and V
domain. The V domain was further purified by ion exchange
chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The
31A4 Fab fragment was expressed in E. coli. This protein was
purified by nickel affinity chromatography, size exclusion
chromatography and ion exchange chromatography.
Complex Formation and Crystallization
The PCSK9 V domain/31A4 complex was made by mixing
a 1.5 molar excess of PCSK9 V domain with 31A4 Fab. The
complex was separated from excess PCSK9 V domain by
purification on a size exclusion chromatography column. The
PCSK9 V domain/31A4 complex crystallized in 1.1 M Suc-
cinic acid pH 7, 2% PEG MME 2000.
Data Collection and Structure Determination
The dataset for the PCSK9 V domain/31A4 crystal was
collected on a Rigaku FR-E x-ray source and processed with
denzo/scalepack (Otwinowski, Z. , Borek, D., Majewski, W.
& Minor, W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensi-
ties. Acta CrystallogrA 59, 228-34 (2003)).
PCSK9 V domain/31A4 crystals grow in the P2,2,2, space
group with unit cell dimensions a=74.6, b=131.1, c=197.9 A.
with two complex molecules per asymmetric unit, and dif-
fract to 2.2 A. resolution. The PCSK9 V domain/31A4 struc-
ture was solved by molecular replacement with the program
MOLREP (CCP4. The CCP4 suite: programs for protein
crystallography. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 50,
760-3 (1994)) using the V domain of the PCSK9 structure
(Piper, D. E.et al. The crystal structure ofPCSK9: a regulator
of plasma LDL-cholesterol. Structure 15, 545-52 (2007)) as
the starting search model. Keeping the PCSK9 450-692 solu-
tion fixed, an antibody variable domain was used as a search
model. After initial refinement, the antibody constant
domains were fit by hand. The complete structure was
improved with multiple rounds of model building with
Quanta and refinement with cnx (Brunger, A. T. et al. Crys-
tallography & NMR system: A new software suite for mac-
romolecular structure determination. Acta Crystallogr D Biol
Crystallogr 54, 905-21 (1998)).
Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as
being all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than
or equal to 5 A. from the PCSK9 partner protein. 5 A. was
chosen as the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms
within a van der Waals radius plus a possible water-mediated
hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids
were determined as all amino acid residues with at least one
atom less than or equal to 8 A. from the PCSK9 partner protein
but not included in the core interaction list. Less than or equal
to 8 A. was chosen as the boundary region cutoff distance to
allow for the length of an extended arginine amino acid.
Amino acids that met these distance criteria were calculated
with the program PyMOL (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System. (Palo Alto, 2002)). Distances
were calculated using the V domain "A" and 31A4 "Ll,HI"
complex.
The crystal structure of the PCSK9 V domain bound to the
Fab fragment of 31A4 was determined at 2.2 A. resolution.
The depictions of the crystal structure are provided in FIGS.
21A-21D. FIGS. 21A-21C shows that the 31A4 Fab binds to
the PCSK9 V domain in the region of subdomains I and 2.

A model of full length PCSK9 bound the 31A4 Fab was
made. The structure of full length PCSK9 was overlaid onto
the PCSK9 V domain from the complex. A figure of this
model is shown in FIG. 21D. The site of the interaction
between the EGFa domain of the LDLR and PCSK9 is high-
lighted.
Analysis of the structure shows where this antibody inter-
acts with PCSK9 and demonstrated that antibodies that do not
bind to the LDLR binding surface of PCSK9 can still inhibit
the degradation of LDLR that is mediated through PCSK9
(when the results are viewed in combination with Example 40
and 41 below). In addition, analysis of the crystal structure
allows for identification of specific amino acids involved in
the interaction between PCSK9 and the 31A4 antibody. Fur-
thermore, the core and boundary regions of the interface on
the PCSK9 surface were also determined. Specific core
PCSK9 amino acid residues of the interaction interface with
31A4 were defined as PCSK9 residues that are within 5 A. of
the 31A4 protein. The core residues are T468, R469, M470,
A471, T472, R496, R499, E501, A502, Q503, R510, H512,
F515, P540, P541, A542, E543, H565, W566, E567, V568,
E569, R592, and E593. Boundary PCSK9 amino acid resi-
dues of the interaction interface with 31A4 were defined as
PCSK9 residues that are 5-8 A. from the 31A4 protein. The
boundary residues are as follows: S465, G466, P467, A473,
I474, R476, G497, E498, M500, G504, K506, L507, V508,
A511, N513, A514, G516, V536, T538, A539, A544, T548,
D570, L571, H591, A594, S595, and H597. Amino acid resi-
dues nearly or completely buried within the PCSK9 protein
are highlighted by underline. As noted herein, the numbering
references the amino acid positions of SEQ ID NO: 3 (ad-
justed as noted herein).
Specific core 31A4 amino acid residues of the interaction
interface with PCSK9 were defined as 31A4 residues that are
within 5 A. of the PCSK9 protein. The core residues for the
31A4 antibody are as follows: Heavy Chain: G27, S28, F29,
S30, A31, Y32, Y33, E50, N52, H53, R56, D58, K76, G98,
Q99, L100, and V101;Light Chain: S31,N32, T33,Y50, S51,
N52, N53, Q54, W92, and D94. Boundary 31A4 amino acid
residues ofthe interaction interface with PCSK9 were defined
as 31A4 residues that are 5-8 A. from the PCSK9 protein. The
boundary residues for 31A4 are as follows: Heavy Chain: V2,
G26, W34, N35, W47, I51, S54, T57, Y59, A96, R97, P102,
F103, and D104; Light Chain: S26, S27, N28, G30, V34,
N35, R55, P56, K67, V91, D93, S95, N97, G98, and W99.
The crystal structure also displayed the spatial require-
ments of this ABP in its interaction with PCSK9.As shown in
this structure, surprisingly, antibodies that bind to PCSK9
without directly preventing PCSK9's interaction with the
LDLR can still inhibit PCSK9's function.
In some embodiments, any antigen binding protein that
binds to, covers, or prevents 31A4 from interacting with any
of the above residues can be employed to bind to or neutralize
PCSK9. In some embodiments, the ABP binds to or interacts
with at least one of the following PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 3)
residues: T468, R469, M470, A471, T472, R496, R499,

In regard to 31A4, while it also has the same distinctions
noted above, there are three additional differences. As shown
in FIG. 22, there are two additional amino acids at the start,
which comes from incomplete processing of the signal pep-
tide in E. co/i expression. In addition, there is one additional
substitution in the 31A4 heavy chain constant region when
compared to SEQ ID NO: 155, which is the adjustment of a L
(in SEQ ID NO: 155) to a H. Finally, 31A4 does have a
glutamine as the initial amino acid of the Fab, rather than the
adjustment to glutamic acid noted above for 21B12 and
31H4.
For all three antibodies, the end of the heavy chain (boxed
in dark grey) differs as well, but the amino acids are not
ordered in the structure so they do not appear in the coordi-
nates. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, his-tags
are not a required part of the ABP and should not be consid-
ered as part of the ABP's sequence, unless explicitly called
out by reference to a specific SEQ ID NO that includes a
histidine tag and a statement that the ABP sequence "includes
the Histidine tag."

14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 of the above residues.
The coordinates for the crystal structures discussed in the
above Examples are are presented in Table 35.1 (full length
PCSK9 and 31H4), Table 35.2 (PCSK9 and EGFa), Table
353 (PCSK9, 31H4, and 21B12),and Table 35.4 (PCSK9 and
31A4). Antigen binding proteins and molecules that interact
with the relevant areas or residues of the structure of PCSK9
(including those areas or residues within 15, 15-8, 8, 8-5, 5, or
fewer angstroms from where EGFa, or the antibodies, interact
with PCSK9) depicted in the figures and/or their correspond-
ing positions on the structures from the coordinates are also
contemplated.
The antibodies that are described in the coordinates were
raised in E. co/i and thus possess some minor amino acid
differences from the fully human antibodies. The first residue
in the variable region was a glutamic acid instead of a
glutamine for the heavy and light chains of 21B12and for the
light chain for 31H4. In addition to the differences in the
sequence ofvariable region, there were also some differences
in the constant region of the antibodies described by the
coordinates (again due to the fact that the antibody was raised
in E. co/i). FIG. 22 highlights (via underlining shading, or
bold) the differences between the constant regions of the
21B12, 31H4, and 31A4 Fabs (raised in E. co/i) when com-
pared to SEQ ID NOs: 156, and 155. For 21B12 31H4, and
31A4, the light chain constant sequence is similar to human
lambda (SEQ ID NO: 156).The underlined glycine residue is
an insertion between where the 21B12 and 31H4 variable
sequences stop and the lambda sequence starts.
For both 21B12 and 31H4, the heavy chain constant is
similar to human IgG4 (SEQ ID NO: 155). The highlighted
differences in FIG. 22 are shown in Table 36.1:

An alternative set of binning experiments was conducted in
addition to the set in Example 10.As in Example 10, ABPs
that compete with each other can be thought of as binding to
10 the same site on the target and in common parlance are said to
"bin" together.
A modification of the Multiplexed Binning method
described by Jia, et al (J.Immunological Methods, 288 (2004)
91-98) was used. Individual bead codes of streptavidin-
16 coated Luminex beads was incubated in 100 ul 0.5 ug/ml
biotinylated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG capture
antibody (BD Pharmingen, ¹555785) for I hour at room
temperature in the dark, then washed 3x with PBSA, phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% bovine serum albumin
20 (BSA).Each bead code was separately incubated with 100ul
2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Coating Antibody) for I hour
then washed 3x with PBSA. The beads were pooled then
dispensed to a 96-well filter plate (Millipore,
¹MSBVN1250). 100 ul of 2 ug/ml purified PCSK9 protein
25 was added to half the wells. Buffer was added to the other half
as control. The reaction was incubated for I hour then
washed. 100ul of a 2 ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibody (Detection
Ab) was added to all the wells, incubated for I hour then
washed. An irrelevant human-IgG (Jackson, ¹009-000-003)
30 was run as another control. 20 ul PE-conjugated monovalent
mouse-anti-human IgG (BD Pharmingen, ¹555787) was
added to each well and incubated for I hour then washed.
Beads were resuspended in 100 ul PBSA and a minimum of
100 events/bead code were collected on the BioPlex instru-
36 ment (BioRad).
Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) of the antibody pair
without PCSK9 was subtracted from signal of the corre-
sponding reaction containing PCSK9. For the antibody pair to
be considered bound simultaneously, and therefore in differ-
40 ent bins, the subtracted signal had to be greater than 3 times
the signal of the antibody competing with itself and the 3
times the signal of the antibody competing with the irrelevant
antibody.
The data from the above is depicted in FIGS. 23A-23D.
46 The ABPs fell into five bins. The shaded boxes indicate ABPs
that can bind simultaneously to PCSK9. The nonshaded
boxes indicate those ABPs that compete with each other for
binding. A summary of the results is shown in Table 37.1.

Epitope Mapping
Western Blot
The present example demonstrates whether or not the
epitopes for the examined ABPs were linear or conforma-
tional. Denaturing reducing and denaturing non-reducing
western blots were run to determine which antibodies have a
conformational epitope. Antibodies that bind to a denaturing
reducing western blot have a linear epitope and are not con-
formational. The results are presented in FIG. 24A and FIG.
24B. For the blot, 0.5 ug/lane of purified full-length human
PCSK9 was run on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and MES
SDS Running Buffer. I ug/ml anti-PCSK9 antibodies, except
0.5 ug/ml 31GI I, were used to probe the blot. I:5000 donkey-
anti-human-IR700 secondary was used and read on a LiCOR
instrument. Antibody 13HI bound to a linear epitope on the
pro-domain of PCSK9. All other antibodies displayed results
that were consistent with conformational epitopes. These gels
split apart the pro-domain from the rest of the protein, and the
pro domain ran at about 15 kDa. In addition, 3C4 and 31A4
appeared to bind to conformational epitopes which were pre-
served by disulfide bonds, as these antibodies bound to
PCSK-9 under denaturing conditions where the disulfide
bonds had been preserved (left) but reducing the samples
(right) eliminated binding.
Example 39
Epitope Mapping
Arginine/Glutamic Acid Scanning
Representative ABPs from each bin (from Example 37)
were selected for further epitope analysis. An arginine/
Bins I (competes with ABP 21B12)and 3 (competes with
31H4) are exclusive ofeach other; bin 2 competes with bins I
and 3; and Bin 4 does not compete with bins I and 3.Bin 5, in
this example, is presented as a "catch all" bin to describe those
ABPs that do not fit into the other bins. Thus, the above
identified ABPs in each of the binds are representative of
different types ofepitope locations on PCSK9, some ofwhich
overlap with each other.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, if the
reference ABP prevents the binding ofthe probe ABP then the
antibodies are said to be in the same bin. The order in which
the ABPs are employed can be important. If ABP A is
employed as the reference ABP and blocks the binding of
ABP B the converse is not always true: ABP B used as the
reference ABP will not necessarily block ABP A. There are a
number of factors in play here: the binding of an ABP can
cause conformational changes in the target which prevent the
binding of the second ABP, or epitopes which overlap but do
not completely occlude each other may allow for the second
ABP to still have enough high-affinity interactions with the
target to allow binding. ABPs with a much higher affinity may
have a greater ability to bump a blocking ABP out of the way.
In general, ifcompetition is observed in either order the AB Ps
are said to bin together, and if both ABPs can block each other
then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely.

glutamic acid-scanning strategy was performed for mapping
ABP binding to PCSK9. By way ofbackground, this method
determines if a residue is part of the structural epitope, mean-
ing those residues in the antigen which contact or are buried
by the antibody. Arginine and glutamic acid sidechains are
charged and bulky and can disrupt antibody binding even if
the mutated residue is not directly involved in antibody bind-
ing.
Residue Selection
The crystal structure of PCSK9 was used to select the
residues to be mutated for epitope mapping. The method used
to choose residues to mutate involved both computational
mechanisms and interactive structure analysis. The PCSK9
structure contained gaps ofmissing residues and was missing
30 amino acids in the N- (ke. , the signal sequence) and 10
amino acids in the C-termini. The internal missing residues
were modeled onto the structure, but the N- and C-terminal
missing residues were not. The solvent exposure ratio for
each residue was calculated: the surface area of each residue
in the context of the protein (SAI) was divided by the surface
area of the residue in a trimer with flanking glycines (SA2)
with a conserved backbone structure. Residues with solvent
exposure ratio greater than 10% (RIO) were selected as well
as the 40 missing terminal residues. From these, prolines and
glycines with positive C& angles were excluded to reduce the
possibility of misfolding. The number of residues to be
mutated in the V domain was reduced by using a solvent
exposure ratio of 37% along with visual inspection of the
entire protein to bring the total number of mutations to 285.
Various orientations of the surface of PCSK9 with these vari-
ous classes identifies are shown in FIG. 25A-25F. In these
figures, lightest gray denotes areas that were not selected or
were deselected. darker gray denotes those residues selected).
Cloning and Expression
Once the residues to be altered were identified, the various
residues were altered. Human PCSK9 was cloned into the
pTT5 vector with a C-terminal Flag-His tag. Mutants were
made from this original construct by site-directed mutagen-
esis using a QuikChange II kit from Stratagene. Sense and
anti-sense oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were
designed using Amgen's MutaGenie software. All PCSK9
constructs were expressed in transiently-transfected 293-6E
cells in 24-well plates and re-racked into three 96-well plates
with a non-mutated PCSK9 control (wild-type, WT) in each
plate. Expression levels and integrity of the recombinant pro-
teins in conditioned media were checked by Western blot. Of
the 285 mutants originally selected, 41 failed in cloning or
expression. 244 mutants were used for epitope mapping. An
alignment ofthe PCSK9 parent sequence and a representative
PCSK9 sequence with the 244 mutated residues is shown in
FIG. 26. Separate constructs were made containing a single
mutation. For the purposes of the epitope sequences and the
epitope based inventions involving changes in binding, the
sequences are provided in reference to SEQ ID NO: I and/or
SEQ ID NO: 303. The sequences in FIG. 26 were the
sequences used for the present binding epitope studies. One
of skill in the art will appreciate that the present results apply
to other PCSK9 variants disclosed herein as well (e.g. , SEQ
ID NO: I and 3, as well as the other allelic variants).
Five antibodies, a representative of each bin, were chosen
for fine epitope mapping. They were 21B12, 31H4, 12HI I,
31A4, 3C4. All conformational epitope antibodies. Three,
21B12,31H4, and 31A4 were also crystallized with PCSK9,
as described above.
Structural and Functional Epitopes
Epitopes can be further defined as structural or functional.
Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural
115
US 8,829,165 B2
116
epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the
affinity of the interaction (e.g. hydrogen bonds, ionic interac-
tions). Structural epitopes can bethought ofas the patch of the
target which is covered by the antibody.
The scanning mutagenesis employed was an arginine and
glutamic acid scan. These two sidechains were chosen due to
their large steric bulk and their charge, which allows muta-
tions that occur in the structural epitope to have a greater
effect on antibody binding. Arginine was generally employed
except when the WT reside was arginine, and in these cases
the residue was mutated to glutamic acid to switch the charge.
For the purpose of epitope mapping, a bead-based multi-
plexed assay was used to measure antibody binding to PCSK9
(Jackson Immunoresearch, ¹109-116-170)was added to each
well and incubated for I hour at RT and washed.
Beads were resuspended in 1%BSA in PBS, shaken for 10
mins and read on the BioPlex instrument (Bio-Rad). The
instrument identifies each bead by its color-code thereby
identifying the specific protein associated with the color code.
At the same time, it measures the amount of antibody bound
to the beads by fluorescence intensity of the PE dye. Antibody
binding to each mutant can then be compared directly its
10
binding to the wild type in the same pool. IL-17R chimera E
was used as a negative control. A summary of all of the
mutants examined is shown in Table 39.1 (with reference to
the sequence numbering used in FIGS. 1A and 26).

and PCSK9 mutants simultaneously. Antibody binding to
mutants was then compared to its binding to the wild-type in
the same well. The variants were split into three groups:
Group I: 81 variants+2 wt controls+I negative control+I
other PCSK9 supernatant; Group 2: 81 variants+2 wt con-
trols+2 negative controls; and Group 3: 82 variants+2 wt
control+ I negative control.
The assay was run as follows: 85 sets of color-coded stre-
pavidin-coated LumAvidin beads (Luminex) were bound
with biotinylated anti-pentaHis antibody (Qiagen, ¹1019225)
for I hour at room temperature (RT) then washed three times
in PBS, 1%BSA, 0.1%Tween 20. Each color-coded bead set
was then allowed to bind to a PCSK9 mutant, wild-type, or
negative control in 150 ul supernatant overnight at 4' C.
The color-coded bead sets, each associated to a specific
protein, were washed and pooled. At this point, there were 3
pools of 85 bead sets, one pool for each group ofmutants and
controls. The beads from each pool were aliquoted to 24 wells
(3 columns) of a 96-well filter plate (Millipore,
¹MSBVN1250). 100 ul of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in 4-fold
dilutions were added to nine columns for triplicate points and
incubated for I hour at RT and washed. 100 ul of I:200
dilution phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc
Bead Variability Study
Before running the epitope mapping binding assay, a vali-
dation experiment was conducted to assess the "bead region"
to "bead region" (B-B)variability. In the validation experi-
ment, all beads were conjugated with the same wild type
5o control protein. Therefore, the difference between beads
regions was due to purely B-B variance and was not con-
founded by difference between wild type and mutant pro-
teins. The titration of antibody was run with twelve replica-
tions in different wells.
55 The objective of this statistical analysis was to estimate the
B-Bvariability of the estimated EC50 ofbinding curves. The
estimated B-B standard deviation (SD) was then used to build
the EC50 confidence intervals of wild type and mutant pro-
teins during curve comparison experiments.
6o A four-parameter logistic model was fitted to the binding
data for each bead region. The resulting file, containing curve
quality control (QC) results and parameter estimates for top
(max), bottom (min), Hillslope (slope), and natural log of
EC50 (xmid) of the curves, was used as the raw data for the
65 analysis. B-B variability for each parameter was then esti-
mated by fitting mixed effect model using SAS PROC
MIXED procedure. Only curves with "good" QC status were
117
US 8,829,165 B2
118
included in the analysis. The final mixed effect model
included only residual (ke. individual bead regions) as ran-
dom effect. Least squares means (LS-mean) for each param-
eter were estimated by the mixed effect model as well. B-B
SD was calculated by taking square root of B-B variance.
Fold change between LS-mean+2SD and LS-mean —2SD,
which represent approximately upper and lower 97.5 percen-
tile of the population, was also calculated. The results are
displayed in Table 39.2

Identifying Residues in the Structural Epitope
A residue was considered part of the structural epitope (a
"hit") when mutating it to arginine or glutamic acid alters
antibody binding. This is seen as a shift in the EC50 or a
reduction of maximum signal compared to antibody binding
to wild type. Statistical analyses of antibody binding curves to
wild type and mutants were used to identify statistically sig-
nificant EC50 shifts. The analysis takes into consideration
variation in the assay and curve fitting.
Hit Identification based on EC50 Comparison
The EC50 and Bmax values were generated from a
Weighted 4-Parameter Logistical model fitted to the binding
data using S-PLUS with VarPower software (Insightful Cor-
poration, Seattle Wash. ). The EC50s of the mutant binding
curves and wild type binding curves were compared. Statis-
tically significant differences were identified as hits for fur-
ther consideration. The curves with "nofit" or "badfit" flags
were excluded from the analysis.
The Variations in EC50 Estimates
Two sources ofvariations were considered in the compari-
son of EC50 estimates, variation from the curve fit and the
bead-bead variation. Wild types and mutants were linked to
different beads, hence their difference are confounded with
the bead-bead difference (described above). The curve fit
variation was estimated by the standard error of the log EC50
estimates. Bead-bead variation was experimentally deter-
mined using an experiment where wild type controls were

linked to each one of the beads (described above). The bead
variation in EC50 estimates of wild type binding curve from
this experiment was used to estimate the bead-bead variation
in the actual epitope mapping experiment.
Testing for EC50 Shift Between Mutants and Wild Type
The comparisons of two EC50s (in log scale) was con-
ducted using Student' s t-test. The t-statistic was calculated as
the ratio between delta (the absolute differences between
EC50 estimates) and the standard deviation of delta. The
variance of delta was estimated by the sum of the three com-
ponents, variance estimate of EC50 for mutant and wild type
curves in the nonlinear regression and two times the bead-
bead variance estimated from a separate experiment. The
multiple of two for the bead-bead variance was due to the
assumption that both mutant and wild type beads had the
same variance. The degree of freedom of the standard devia-
tion of delta was calculated using the Satterthwaite's (1946)
approximation. Individual p-values and confidence intervals
(95%and 99%)were derived based on Student's t distribution
for each comparison. In the case of multiple wild type con-
trols, a conservative approach was taken by picking the wild
type control that was most similar to the mutant, i.e., picking
the ones with the largest p-values.
Multiplicity adjustments were important to control the
false positive(s) while conducting a large number of tests
simultaneously. Two forms of multiplicity adjustment were
implemented for this analysis: family wise error (FWE) con-
trol and false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FWE
approach controls the probability that one or more hits are not
real; FDR approach controls the expected proportion of false
positive among the selected hits. The former approach is more
conservative and less powerful than the latter one. There are
many methods available for both approaches, for this analy-
sis, the Hochberg's (1988) method for FWE analysis and
Benjamini-Hochberg's (1995)FDR method for FDR analysis
were selected. Adjusted p-values for both approaches were
calculated.
Results
EC50 Shift
Mutations whose EC50 is significantly different from wild
type, e.g. , having a False Discovery Rate adjusted p-value for
the whole assay of 0.01 or less, were considered part of the
structural epitope. All the hits also had a Familywise type I
error rate adjusted p-value for each antibody of less than 0.01
except residue R185E for antibody 31H4 which had an FWE
adjusted p-value per antibody of 0.0109.The residues in the
structural epitope of the various antibodies determined by
EC50 shift are shown in Table 39.3 (point mutations are with
reference to SEQ ID NO: I and 303)

The percent maximum signal was calculated using the
maximum signal from the curve fitting (BmaxPerWT) and
raw data point (RawMaxPerWT). Mutations that reduced the 5
antibody binding maximum signal by )70oro as compared to
to wild type signal or that reduced the signal of one antibody
compared to other antibodies by )50'ro when all other anti-
bodies are at least 40'ro of wild type were considered hits and

To further examine how these residues form part ofor all of
45 the relevant epitopes, the above noted positions were mapped
onto various crystal structure models, the results are shown in
FIG. 27A through 27E. FIG. 27A depicts the 21B12epitope
hits, as mapped onto a crystal structure of PCSK9 with the
21B12 antibody. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as
50
follows: light gray indicates those residues that were not
mutated (with the exception of those residues that are explic-
itly indicated on the structure) and darker gray indicates those
residues mutated (a minority of which failed to express).
Residues that are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless
of the shading indicated on the figure) and resulted in a
significant change in EC50 and/or Bmax The epitope hits
were based on Bmax shift. In this figure, 31H4 is behind 21
B12.
60 FIG. 27B depicts the 31H4 epitope hits, as mapped onto a
crystal structure ofPCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12antibodies.
The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray
indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the
exception ofthose residues that are explicitly indicated on the
65 structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a
minority ofwhich failed to express). Residues that are explic-
itly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated
121
US 8,829,165 B2
122
on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50
and/or Bmax. The epitope hits were based on the EC50 shift.
FIG. 27C depicts the 31A4 epitope hits, as mapped onto a
crystal structure ofPCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12antibodies.
The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray
indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the
exception ofthose residues that are explicitly indicated on the
structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a
minority ofwhich failed to express). Residues that are explic-
itly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated
on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50
and/or Bmax. The epitope hits were based on the EC50 shift.
31A4 antibody is known to bind to the V-domain of PCSK9,
which appears consistent with the results presented in FIG.
27C.
FIG. 27D depicts the 12HI I epitope hits, as mapped onto
the crystal structure of PCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12 anti-
bodies. The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows:
light gray indicates those residues that were not mutated (with
the exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on
the structure) and darker gray indicates those residues
mutated (a minority ofwhich failed to express). Residues that
are explicitly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading
indicated on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in
EC50 and/or Bmax. 12HI I competes with 21B12 and 31H4
in the binning assay described above.
FIG. 27E depicts the 3C4 epitope hits, as mapped onto the
crystal structure ofPCSK9 with 31H4 and 21B12antibodies.
The structure identifies PCSK9 residues as follows: light gray
indicates those residues that were not mutated (with the
exception of those residues that are explicitly indicated on the
structure) and darker gray indicates those residues mutated (a
minority ofwhich failed to express). Residues that are explic-
itly indicated were tested (regardless of the shading indicated
on the figure) and resulted in a significant change in EC50
and/or Bmax.
3C4 does not compete with 21B12and 31H4 in the binning
assay. 3C4 binds to the V-domain in the domain binding assay
(see results from Example 40, FIGS. 2SA and 2SB).
While there were approximately a dozen mutants that
could have been expected to have an effect on binding (based
upon the crystal structure), the present experiment demon-
strated that, surprisingly, they did not. As will be appreciated
by one of skill in the art, the results presented above are in
good agreement with the crystal structures and PCSK-9's
binding of these antibodies. This demonstrates that the pro-
vided structural and corresponding functional data
adequately identifies the key residues and areas of interaction
of the neutralizing ABPs and PCSK9. Thus, variants of the
ABPs that possess the ability to bind to the above noted areas
are adequately provided by the present description.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the
B-max drop and EC50 shift hits can be considered manifes-
tations of the same phenomenon, strictly speaking, a B-max
drop alone does not reflect a loss of affinity per se but, rather,
the destruction of some percentage of the epitope of an anti-
body. Although there is no overlap in the hits determined by
B-max and EC50, mutations with a strong affect on binding
may not allow for the generation ofa useful binding curve and
hence, no EC50 can be determined for such variants.
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, ABPs in the
same bin (with the exception of bin 5, which as noted above,
is a general catch all bin) likely bind to overlapping sites on
the target protein. As such, the above epitopes and relevant
residues can generally be extended to all such ABPs in the
same bin.

Thus, those embodiments described herein with reference
to SEQ ID NO: I can also be described, by their above noted
corresponding position with reference to SEQ ID NO: 3.
Example 40
PCSK9 Domain Binding Assay
The present example examined where on PCSK9 the vari-
ous ABPs bound.
Clear, 96 well maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated over-
night with 2 ug/ml of various anti-PCSK9 antibodies diluted
in PBS. Plates were washed thoroughly with PBS/0. 05%
Tween-20 and then blocked for two hours with 3%BSA/PB S.
To further examine the above results in regard to ABP
31H4, position E181R,which, according to the above crystal
structure, was predicted to interact with R185 to form part of
the surface that interacts with the ABP, was also altered
(E181R). The results, while not statistically significant on
their own, were, when combined with the crystal structure,
demonstrative of 31H4 interacting with E181R (data not
shown). Thus, position 181 also appears to form part of the
epitope for the 31H4 ABP.
As noted above, the above binding data and epitope char-
acterization references a PCSK9 sequence (SEQ ID NO: I)
that does not include the first 30 amino acids ofPCSK9. Thus,
the numbering system of this protein fragment, and the SEQ
ID NO: s that refer to this fragment, are shifted by 30 amino
acids compared to the data and experiments that used a full
length PCSK9 numbering system (such as that used in the
crystal study data described above). Thus, to compare these
results, an extra 30 amino acids should be added to the posi-
tions in each of the above epitope mapping results. For
example, position 207 of SEQ ID NO: I (or SEQ ID NO:
303), correlates to position 237 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (the full
length sequence, and the numbering system used throughout
the rest of the specification). Table 39.6 outlines how the
above noted positions, which reference SEQ ID NO: I (and/
or SEQ ID NO: 303) correlate with SEQ ID NO: 3 (which
includes the signal sequence).

After washing, plates were incubated for two hours with
either full length PCSK9 (aa 31-692 SEQ ID NO: 3, procat
PCSK9 (aa 31-449 SEQ ID NO: 3) or v-domain PCSK9 (aa
450-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3) diluted in general assay diluent
(Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC). Plates were washed
and a rabbit polyclonal biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibody
(D8774), which recognizes the procat and v-domain as well
as full-length PCSK9, was added at I ug/ml (in 1% BSA/
PBS). Bound full-length, procat or v-domain PCSK9 was
detected by incubation with neutravidin-HRP (Thermo Sci-
entific) at 200 ng/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS) followed by TMB
substrate (KPL) and absorbance measurement at 650 nm. The
results, presented in FIGS. 2SA and 2SB, demonstrate the
ability of the various ABS to bind to various parts of PCSK9.
As shown in FIG. 2SB,ABP 31A4 binds to the V domain of
PCSK9.
Example 41
Neutralizing, Non-Competitive Antigen Binding
Proteins
The present example demonstrates how to identify and
characterize an antigen binding protein that is non-competi-
tive with LDLR for binding with PCSK9, but is still neutral-
izing towards PCSK9 activity. In other words, such an antigen
binding protein will not block PCSK9 from binding to LDLR,
but will prevent or reduce PCSK9 mediated LDLR degrada-
tion.
Clear, 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 ug/ml of
goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&D Systems) diluted in
buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4). Plates were
washed thoroughly with buffer A and then blocked for 2 hours
with buffer B (1% milk in buffer A). After washing, plates
were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 ug/ml of LDL receptor
(R&D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented
with 10 mM CaC12). Concurrent with this incubation, 20
ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 100
ng/ml of antibody diluted in buffer A or buffer A alone (con-
trol). The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and
the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was trans-
5

ferred to them and incubated for I hour at room temperature.
Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was
detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at
500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL). The
signal was quenched with IN HCI and the absorbance read at
450 nm. The results are presented in FIG. 2SC, which shows
that while ABP 31H4 inhibits LDLR binding, ABP 31A4
does not inhibit LDLR binding to PCSK9. In combination
with the results from Example 40 and shown in FIGS. 2SA
and 2SB, it is clear that 31A4 ABP binds to the V domain of
PCSK9 and does not block the interaction of PCSK9 with
LDLR.
Next, the Ability of ABP 31A4 to serve as a neutralizing
ABP was further confirmed via a cell LDL uptake assay (as
described in the examples above). The results of this LDL
uptake assay are presented in FIG. 2SD. As shown in FIG.
2SD, ABP 31A4 displays significant PCSK9 neutralizing
ability. Thus, in light ofExample 40 and the present results, it
is clear that ABPs can bind to PCSK9 without blocking the
PCSK9 and LDLR binding interaction, while still being use-
ful as neutralizing PCSK9 ABPs.
