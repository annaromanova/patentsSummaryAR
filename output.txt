l&EVINI1IONS
An '*ant&body" is an inm&umiglobulu& inolecule capable of
specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate. poly-
nucisx&tide. lipid. polypcptickx ctc, thmugh at least onc ant&- m&
gen recognit&on site, located in the vanable region of the
immunoglobulin molecule As used herein. the tenn encim&-
passes not only u&tact polyclonal or monoclonal ant&bodies,
but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fabk F(ab')s. Fv),
single chain (ScFv) m&d domain antibodies), and fusion pro- (
te&ns comprising an antibody portion, and any other mod&fied
configuration of the inununooJobufin molecule that com-
prises an nnrigen recognition site. An antibody includes m&
annbody ofany class, such as IgO. IgA. or IgM (or sub-class
thereof) and the antibody need not be of any part&cular class.
Depending on the antibody amino acid sequm&ce of the con-
stant doma&n of &ts heavy cha&ns. immunoglobulins can be
assigned to difTerent classes. There are five major classes of
u&ununoglobuln&s: IgA, IgD. IgE. IgCI. m&d lgM. u&d several
of these may be further div&ded into subclasses (iso&&T&es),
c.g, IgCil. IgC12, Ig()3, Ig(14. IgAI and ISA2 Thc lmavy-
chain constant domau&s that correspond to the difierent
classes of &nununoglobulins are called alplm, delta, eps&ion,
gamma and im&, respcctivcly. The auburn& structures a&xl
tluee-dimensional conti urat&ons of diferent classes of
&&ainu&&ogl(lbu1ins are well known
As usvd hereu&. '*monoclonal anl&body*'eli:rs to an mui-
body obtained from a population of substantially homoge-
ncoms antibodiew i c., tlm individual antibodies comprising
the population are identimd except lor possible naturally-
occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts.
Monockmal antibodies nre highly spccilic., being directed
against a single m&tigenic site. Furthermore. &n contrast to
polyclonal antibody prepamtions, which typically include
d&fferent antibod&es directed s ainst d&fferent detenn&nants
(ep&topes). each monoclonal antibody is d&rected against a
single determinant on the nntigcn. '11&e modifier "mono-
clonal" u&d&cates the character of the anubody as be&n
obtmned from a substantially homogeneous populat&on of
a&uibodics, m&d &s nol to be coustrucxI as requ&ring producuon
of the ant&bodv by any particular method. 1&or example, the
monoclonal antibodies to be uscxI in accordmlcc with thc
present invention nuiy be made by the hybridoma method lira&
described by Kohier and Milste&n, 1975, Nature 25Cx495, or
may bc m&xle by r&vombinant DNA methods such as
described u& U S. Pat No. 4.816.567. The monoclonal anti-
bodies may also be isolatscd from phage libraries genernted
using thc techniquca dcscribcd in McCaiTerly cl al, 1990.

As used herein, "lnunanized'ntibody refers to filnns of
non-lummn (e g, im&rine) mitibodies ihal are chuu eric immu-
noglobulins, inununoglobulin clm&ns, or fraynents thereof
(such as Fv. Fab. Fab'. F(ab')s or other antigen-binding sub-
sequences of ant&bod&es) that contain m»umnl sequence
derived from non-human inununoglobulin. Preferably,
humnnizcd antibodies me humnn immunoglobulins (recipi-
ent ant&body) in wluch res&dues from a complementary deter-
mining region (CI&R) of the recipim&t are replacsxl by residues
from a CDR ofa non-human spec&es (donor ant&body) such as
mouse, mt. or rabbit hav&ng the des&red specific&ty, affinity,
and capacity. In some instiu&ces, F& I'ramev'ork reg&mt (FR)
residues of the hmnan inununoglobulu& are replaced by cor-
respond&ng non-human res&dues. Furthermore, the human-
ized m&t&body may comprise residues thai are found neither u&
the recipient antibody nor in the imported C DR or framework
sequcnccs, but arc included to furtlmr refine and optimize
antibody perfonnance. In general. the humanized antibody
will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically
two. variable dmnains. in && hich all or substantially all oi'he
CDR reg&ons correspi&nd lo those o I'a non-human unnn&no-
globulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those
of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence The
human&zed antibody optimally also w&11 comprise at least a
portion of an imnnu&oglobulin consmnt region or domain
(Fc), typically that ofa luunan immunoglobulin. Preferred are

by three complementarity determining regions (C'DRs) tlmt
contain hypervariable regions. The ( DRs in each chain are so
lmld togetlmr in close proximity by tlm FRs and, with thc
CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the fomiation of the
antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two
techniques for determining CDRs: (I) an approach based on
cross-species sequence vanability (i.e., Kabat et al. 4.
Sequences of Vroteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed.,
1991. National Institutes of I iealth. Bethesda Md.)k and (2)
an approach based on c&ystalloyaphic studies of antigen-

A "PCSK9ants onlstaptamer,"wluchcomprisesamicleic
acid or pmtein sequence. is, for example, selected from a
large pool of rwidom sequences and specifically binds I
Vt SK9. I'he nucleic acid of the aptamer is double-stranded
DNA or single-strmid RNA Nucleic acid aptwncrs can
uiclude moditied bases or functional groups, uicluding but
not limited to 2ufluorine nucleotides and 2LO-methyl nucle-
otidcs Aptamcrs can include hydrophilic polymers. for ai
example, polyethylene glycol. Aptamers may be made by
methods known in the art and selected for Vt SK9 antagonist
acuvity by routine modification of the methods ihsclosed in
the Examples.
As hhssxf herein, an mltibody, peptide, or aptahucr "interacts r
with" PCSK9 when the equilibrium dissociation constant ls
equal to or less titan 20 BM, preferably less than about 6 BM,
morc prefcmbly less than about 1 nM, most prcti.rably less
than about 0.2 nM, as measured by the methods disclosed
herein in Example 2.
An epitope that "prefcrcntially binds" or "specifically
buids" (used ulterchangeably herein) to an antibody or a
polypeptide is a tenn ii el 1 understood in the art. and methods
to deiernune such specdic or preterentud binding are also
well known ln the art. A molecule is said to exlublt "speci bc
binding.'r *'pret'Lrential binding*'t't reacts or associates
more frequently. more rapidly, uith greater duration and/or
with yester affiiuty with a particular cell or substance than it
does with altcrnatilw cells or substances An antibody "spe-
cifically bulds" or "preferential ly binds" to a target lf it buids
with greater atfinity, avidity, more readily, mid/or with greater
duration Ihnn il binds to other substnnces. For ex uuple. Wi
antibody that specificallv or preferential ly binds to a I'(.'SK9
epitopc is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater
afiimty, avidity. more readily, and/or lvith grwiter duration
than it binds to other V( SK9 epitopes or non-p(.'SK9
epitopcs. It is also understood by reading this definitiml that,
for example, an antibody (or moiety or epltope) that specif-
icall or preferentially binlLS to a first target may or may not
specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such,
"specific binding" or "preferential binding" does not neces-
sarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding.
Generally. but not necessartly. reference to binding means
preferential binding.

As know n in the art. rim term "Fc region" is used to dctinc
a C-ternunal region of an utuuunoglobulin heavy clmsln. The
'Fc region" may bee native scsquence Fc region ore variant Fc
fcgl 011. Although hie boundaries of the Fc region ofan imnni-
noglobulul heavy chain might vary, the human IgCh heaiq
chain Fc region is usually defined to snatch from ml amino
acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230. io the car-
boxyl-terminus thereof. The numbering of the residues in the
Fc region is that of Ihc FIJ index as in Kabat Kabai et al,

As used in tlw art, 'Fc receptor" and "FcR'* describe a
receptor that binds to the Fc re ion ol an uitibody. The pre-
ferred FcR is a native sequence lnuuml FcR Moreover, a
prcfcrrel FcR is onc which hinds an I (i antibody (a gmnma

The term *'compete*h as used hcrcin with regard to an
ant&body. means that a first antibody. or an antigen-buid&ng s
ponion thereof, binds to an epitope in a manner sufficiently
sinular to the b&nd&ng of a second antibody. or a» u&ugen-
b&ndm portion thereof. such tlmt the result of binduig of the

tirst antibody, cnn, but need not be the case Thnr is, a tirst
anl&body can udiibil lhe binding of a svcond antibody lo ils

the first antibody to its respective cpitopc. However, where
each antibody detectably inlnb&ts the binding of the other
m&tibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the
same, grcalcr. or lesser oxtcnh tlm antibodies are snid to sc
"cross-compete" v;ith each other for bind&ng of their respec-

In an al ten&ative. the polyoucleotide sequence may be used
for genetic nianipulation to "humanize" tlm antibody or to
improve the aiffimty. or other charactertst&cs of the antibody.
For example, the constam rey'on may bc engineered to more
nearly resemble human constant regions hi avoid immune
response if the ant&body is used in cl&nical trtals and treat-
ments in hunuins. It mny be desirable to genetically manipu-
late the ant&body sequence to obtain greater aiiimty to PC SK9
and greater efficacy u& inlubiting PCSK9). It will be apparent
to one of skill in tlm art that one or more polynuchx&tide
changes can be made to the PCSK9 antagonist ant&body and
still maintain its binding ability to VCSK9.

"chain shufiiingy (Marks et al.. 1992, Bio/Teclmol. 10:779-
783). In this method, the affinity of "primary'* lmman anti-
bodies ohtaiiwd by phage display can be improved by sequen-
tially replac&ng the heavy and 1&ght chain V region enes w&th
repertoires of naturally occu&ring variants (repertoires) of V

attaclnncnt of one of the sugnrs N-acctylgalactosamine,
galactose, or xy lose to a hydro xyainu&o acid, most conunonly
nn serine or tlueonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxy-
lysiim may also be used
Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody &s conve-
niently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence
such that it conmins one or more of the above-described
tripeptide sequences (f&ir N-linked glycosylation sites). The
altemti on may also be made by the addition of, or substitution
by, one or more senne or tlu eon&ac residues to the sequence of
the onginal antibody (for 0-linked gfycosylation sites).
Thc glycosylation pattern ofantibodies may also be altered
u without alteung the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glyco-
sylation largely depends on tlie host cell used to express the
antibody Since the cell type used lor expression of recombi-
nunt glycoproteins. e.g., antibodies, as potential therapeutics

as I'CR-mediated mutagenesis, in wluch the mutated nucle-
otidcs nre incorporated into tlm P('R primem such tluit the
PCR product contmns the desired mutations or site-directed
mutagenesis.
One type of substitution, fiir example. tlmt may bc made is /
to change one or more cysteines in the antibody, which may
be cliemically reactive, to another residue. such as, without
limitation, alaninc or serine. For exanlplc, there can be a
substitution of a non-canonical cysteine. The substitution cmi
be made in U CDR or fmmew ork region of a variable domaui
or in the constmlt domain ol'n antibody. In some embodi-
nlents, the cvsteinc is canonical
The antibodies may also be modified, e.g., in the variable
domauis of the heavy and/or light chains. e... to alter a
binding property of the anubody I or ex unple, a mutation
nlay bc maCk in onc or morc of tlm C'DR regions to increase
or decrense the K» of thc mitibody I'or PCSK9. to increase or
decrease k,C or to alter tile binding specificity of the antibody.
Techniques~in site-direcmd mutageiwsis nre v;cll-known in
the art. See. e.g., Sambrook et al, and Ausubel et al., supra.
A modification or mutation may also be made in a frame-
work region or constmlt domaul to increase the half-fife of a
I'C SK9 antibody. See, e.g., PCT Pub l. No. WO 00/09560. A
nnimtion in a framewnrk region or constant domain can also
be made to alter the unnulnogemcity of the antibody, to
provide a site for covalent or ixm-covalent binding to another
molecule. or to alter such properties as cmnplement lixntion,
PCR bmdin and anubody-dependent cell-mediated cytotox-
icity. According to the uivention. a single antibody may have

Another type of amino acid substinluon tlrat may be made
is to remove potential proteolytic sites In the antibody. Such
sites may occur in a ('DR or franwwork region of n vtmiablc
domaui or In the constanl dom Un of an antibody. Subslitution
of cysteine residues and removal of proteolytic sites may
divroase thc risk ofheterogeneity in the antibody product and
tluls increase its homogeneity. Another type of amulo acid
substitution eliminates a~sparaginc-giycinc pairs, which form
potential deanudation sites. by altering one or both of the
residues. In miother example. thc (utenninal lysins of the

inlubiti&m ofP('SK9-I,DI R bindmg by mitibodies, we tested
the P(.'SK9 antibodies tliat partially or completely blocked
PCSK9 function on I,I)I R and representative& of antibodies
that do not block. All partial antagonistic antibodies also
partially inhibited LDI,R extmcellular domain binding to
PCSK9. except one. Antagonisuc antibodies that can com-
pletely block PCSK9 function, namely 4A5, 5A10, 6i&6 and
7D4 also completely inhibited LDLR cxtmcellular domam
