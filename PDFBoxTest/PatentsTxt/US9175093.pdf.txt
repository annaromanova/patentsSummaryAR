11 Claims, 30 Drawing Sheets
The present invention provides antagonizing antibodies, anti-
gen-binding portions thereof, and aptamers that bind to pro-
protein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Also
provided are antibodies directed to peptides, in which the
antibodies bind to PCSK9. The invention further provides a
method of obtaining such antibodies and antibody-encoding
nucleic acid. The invention further relates to therapeutic
methods for use of these antibodies and antigen-binding por-
tions thereof to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels and/or for the
treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular disease,
including treatment of hypercholesterolemia.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to antibodies, e.g. , full length
antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof, peptides, and
aptamers that antagonize the activity of extracellular propro-
tein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), including its
interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor
(LDLR). More specifically, the invention relates to composi-
tions comprising antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides,
and/or aptamers and methods ofusing these antibodies and/or
peptides and/or aptamers as a medicament. The antagonist
PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers can be used thera-
peutically to lower LDL-cholesterol levels in blood, and can
be used in the prevention and/or treatment of cholesterol and
lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including familial hyperc-
holesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis,
and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD).
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Millions of people in the U.S. are at risk for heart disease
and resulting cardiac events. CVD and underlying atheroscle-
rosis is the leading cause of death among all demographic
groups, despite the availability of therapies directed at its
multiple risk factors. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arter-
ies and is responsible for coronary heart disease associated
with many deaths in industrialized countries. Several risk
factors for coronary heart disease have now been identified:
dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet,
inactivity and stress. The most clinically relevant and com-
mon dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in beta-
lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL)
with hypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of
hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrlckson et al. , 1967,N Engl I Med.
276:34-42, 94-103, 148-156,215-225, and 273-281).There is
a long-felt significant unmet need with respect to CVD with
60-70% of cardiovascular events, heart attacks and strokes
occurring despite the treatment with statins (the current stan-
dard of care in atherosclerosis). Moreover, new guidelines
suggest that even lower LDL levels should be achieved in
order to protect high risk patients from premature CVD [Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2004].
PCSK9, also known as NARC-1, was identified as a protein
with a genetic mutation in some forms of familial hypercho-
lesterolemia. PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen that under-
goes autocatalytic processing at the motif LVFAQ in the

endoplasmic reticulum. Population studies have shown that
some PCSK9 mutations are "gain-of-function" and are found
in individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholester-
olemia, while other "loss-of-function" (LOF) mutations are
linked with reduced plasma cholesterol. Morbidity and mor-
tality studies in this group clearly demonstrated that reducing
PCSK9 function significantly diminished the risk of cardio-
vascular disease.
Of significant importance to the treatment of CVD, a LOF
mutation may sensitize humans to statins, allowing for efft-
cacy at a lower dose (hence, improving risks associated with
safety and tolerance) and potentially achieving lower plasma
cholesterol levels than with current therapies.
PCS K9 is secreted into the plasma predominantly by hepa-
tocytes. Genetic modulation of PCSK9 in mice confirmed the
ability of PCSK9 to regulate blood lipids, and suggested that
it acts to down-regulate hepatic LDLR protein levels.
The mechanism by which, and the site at which, PCSK9
down-regulates LDLR protein has not been clearly estab-
lished. When over-expressed, PCSK9 may act both within the
hepatocyte and as a secreted ligand for LDLR. There is strong
evidence that extracellular PCSK9 binds to cell surface
LDLR and promotes LDLR degradation at an intracellular
site. However, it is also possible that PCSK9 could interact
with the LDLR when the two proteins are translated within
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic through endoso-
mal compartments towards the cell membrane. Maxwell et
al. , 2005, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 16:167-172, showed that
PCSK9-mediated LDLR endocytosis and degradation was
not altered by proteosome inhibitors nor was it modulated by
different classes of lysosomal and nonlysosomal proteases.
Two naturally occurring familial hypercholesterolemia muta-
tions, S127R and D129G, have been reported to be defective
in autoprocessing and secretion as levels of these mutant
proteins were greatly reduced or undetectable in the media of
transfected cells. Yet these mutants demonstrated an
enhanced ability to down-regulate LDLR, consistent with
their identification in individuals with high plasma LDL
(Homer et al. , 2008, Atherosclerosis 196:659-666;Cameron
et al. , 2006 Human Molecular Genetics 15:1551-1558;Lam-
bert et al. , 2006, TRENDS in Endocrinology and Metabolism
17:79-81.Since these mutants apparently do not get secreted
extracellularly, and yet do downregulate LDLR, this strongly
suggests that an intracellular site of action is physiologically
important.
From the information available in the art, and prior to the
present invention, it remained unclear whether the introduc-
tion of an antibody-, peptide-, or aptamer-based PCSK9
antagonist into the blood circulation to selectively antagonize
extracellular PCSK9 would be effective to reduce hypercho-
lesterolemia and the associated incidence of CVD and, if so,
what properties ofa PCSK9 antagonist are needed for such in
vivo effectiveness.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to antagonist antibodies, peptides,
and aptamers that selectively interact with and inhibit PCSK9
function. It is demonstrated for the first time that certain
PCSK9 antagonists are effective in vivo to lower blood cho-
lesterol.
In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated
antagonist ofPCSK9 which comprises an antibody, a peptide,
or an aptamer, which interacts with PCSK9 and when admin-
istered to a subject lowers the LDL-cholesterol level in blood
US 9,175,093 B2
of said subject. The antagonist can be an antibody, for
example, a monoclonal antibody or human, humanized, or
chimeric antibody.
In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated
anti-PCSK9 antibody which specifically binds to PCSK9 and
which is a full antagonist of the PCSK9-mediated effect on
LDLR levels when measured in vitro using the LDLR down
regulation assay in Huh7 cells disclosed herein.
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides an iso-
lated antibody which antagonizes the extracellular interaction
ofPCSK9 with the LDLR, as measured by PCSK9 binding to
the LDLR in vitro, and, when administered to a subject,
lowers the LDL-cholesterol level in blood of said subject.
Preferably, the antibody recognizes an epitope on human
PCS K9 that overlaps with more than about 75% of the surface
on PCSK9 that interacts with the EGF-like domain of the
LDLR as described in Kwon et al. , 2008, PNAS, 105:1820-
1825.
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides an anti-
body that recognizes a first epitope of PCSK9 that overlaps
with a second epitope that is recognized by a monoclonal
antibody selected from the group consisting of 5AIO, which
is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the
American Type Culture Collection and assigned accession
number PTA-8986; 4A5, which is produced by a hybridoma
cell line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection
and assigned accession number PTA-8985; 6F6, which is
produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the Ameri-
can Type Culture Collection and assigned accession number
PTA-8984, and 7D4, which is produced by a hybridoma cell
line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and
assigned accession number PTA-8983.
In another embodiment, the invention provides an antibody
to human PCSK9, wherein the antibody recognizes an
epitope on human PCSK9 comprising amino acid residues

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to antibodies, peptides, and
aptamers that antagonize the function ofextracellular PCSK9
including its interaction with the LDLR. More specifically,
the invention relates to methods of making antagonist PCSK9
antibodies, peptides, and aptamers, compositions comprising
these antibodies, peptides, and/or aptamers, and methods of
using these antibodies, peptides, and/or aptamers as a medi-
cament. The antagonist PCSK9 antibodies and peptides can
be used to lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels, and can be
used in the prevention and/or treatment of cholesterol and
lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including familial hyperc-
holesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis,
and, more generally, CVD.

DEFINITIONS
An "antibody" is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of
specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, poly-
nucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc. , through at least one anti-
gen recognition site, located in the variable region of the
immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encom-
passes not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies,
but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')~, Fv),

single chain (ScFv) and domain antibodies), and fusion pro-
teins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that com-
prises an antigen recognition site. An antibody includes an
antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class
thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class.
Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the con-
stant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be
assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of
immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several
of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes),
e.g. , IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAI and IgA2. The heavy-
chain constant domains that correspond to the different
classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon,
gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and
three-dimensional configurations of different classes of
immunoglobulins are well known.
As used herein, "monoclonal antibody" refers to an anti-
body obtained from a population of substantially homoge-
neous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising
the population are identical except for possible naturally-
occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts.
Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed
against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to
polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include
different antibodies directed against different determinants
(epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a
single determinant on the antigen. The modifier "mono-
clonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being
obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of
antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production
of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the
monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the
present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first
described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495, or
may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as
described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. The monoclonal anti-
bodies may also be isolated from phage libraries generated
using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. , 1990,
Nature 348:552-554, for example.
As used herein, "humanized" antibody refers to forms of
non-human (e.g. , murlne) antibodies that are chimeric immu-
noglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof
(such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')~ or other antigen-binding sub-
sequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence
derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Preferably,
humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipi-
ent antibody) in which residues from a complementary deter-
mining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues
from a CDR ofa non-human species (donor antibody) such as
mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity,
and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR)
residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by cor-
responding non-human residues. Furthermore, the human-
ized antibody may comprise residues that are found neither in
the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework
sequences, but are included to further refine and optimize
antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody
will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically
two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the
CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immuno-
globulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those
of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The
humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain
(Fc), typically that ofa human immunoglobulin. Preferred are
antibodies having Fc regions modified as described in WO
US 9,175,093 B2
10
99/58572. Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or
more CDRs (CDRLI, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRHI, CDRH2,
and/or CDR H3) which are altered with respect to the original
antibody, which are also termed one or more CDRs "derived
from" one or more CDRs from the original antibody.
As used herein, "human antibody" means an antibody hav-
ing an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of an anti-
body that can be produced by a human and/or which has been
made using any of the techniques for making human antibod-
ies known to those skilled in the art or disclosed herein. This
definition of a human antibody includes antibodies compris-
ing at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one
human light chain polypeptide. One such example is an anti-
body comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain
polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using vari-
ous techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the
human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that
phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al. ,
1996,Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314;Sheets et al. , 1998,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom
and Winter, 1991,J. Mol. Biol., 227:381;Marks et al. , 1991,
J. Mol. Biol. , 222:581).Human antibodies can also be made
by immunization of animals into which human immunoglo-
bulin loci have been transgenically introduced in place of the
endogenous loci, e.g. , mice in which the endogenous immu-
noglobulin genes have been partially or completely inacti-
vated. This approach is described in U.S.Pat. Nos. 5,545,807;
5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625, 126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016.
Alternatively, the human antibody may be prepared by
immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an anti-
body directed against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes
may be recovered from an individual or may have been immu-
nized in vitro). See, e.g. , Cole et al. Monoclonal Antibodies
and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77, 1985; Boerner et al. ,
1991, J. Immunol. , 147 (I):86-95; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,
373.
A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable
region of the antibody light chain or the variable region of the
antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. As
known in the art, the variable regions of the heavy and light
chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected
by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that
contain hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are
held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the
CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the
antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two
techniques for determining CDRs: (I) an approach based on
cross-species sequence variability (Le., Kabat et al.
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed. ,
1991,National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md. )); and (2)
an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-
antibody complexes (Al-Iazikani et al, 1997, J. Molec. Biol.
273:927-948). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs
defined by either approach or by a combination of both
approaches.
As known in the art a "constant region" of an antibody
refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain or the
constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in
combination.
As used herein, the term "PCSK9" refers to any form of
PCSK9 and variants thereof that retain at least part of the
activity of PCSK9. Unless indicated differently, such as by
specific reference to human PCSK9, PCSK9 includes all
mammalian species of native sequence PCSK9, e.g. , human,
canine, feline, equine, and bovine. One exemplary human
PCSK9 is found as Uniprot Accession Number Q8NBP7
(SEQ ID NO:188).

As used herein, a "PCSK9 antagonist" refers to an anti-
body, peptide, or aptamer that is able to inhibit PCSK9 bio-
logical activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by
PCSK9 signaling, including PCSK9-mediated down-regula-
tion of the LDLR, and PCSK9-mediated decrease in LDL
blood clearance. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody encompasses
antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce (to any
degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological activity,
including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signal-
ing, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular
response to PCSK9. For purpose of the present invention, it
will be explicitly understood that the term "PCSK9 antago-
nist antibody" encompasses all the previously identified
terms, titles, and functional states and characteristics
whereby the PCSK9 itself, a PCSK9 biological activity (in-
cluding but not limited to its ability to mediate any aspect of
interaction with the LDLR, down regulation of LDLR, and
decreased blood LDL clearance), or the consequences of the
biological activity, are substantially nullified, decreased, or
neutralized in any meaningful degree. In some embodiments,
a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds PCSK9 and prevents
interaction with the LDLR. Examples of PCSK9 antagonist
antibodies are provided herein.
As used herein a "full antagonist" is an antagonist which, at
an effective concentration, essentially completely blocks a
measurable effect ofPCSK9. By a partial antagonist is meant
an antagonist that is capable of partially blocking a measur-
able effect, but that, even at a highest concentration is not a
full antagonist. By essentially completely is meant at least
about 80%, preferably, at least about 90%,more preferably, at
least about 95%, and most preferably, at least about 98% or
99% of the measurable effect is blocked. The relevant "mea-
surable effects" are described herein and include down regu-
lation of LDLR by a PCSK9 antagonist as assayed in Huh7
cells in vitro, in vivo decrease in blood (or plasma) levels of
total cholesterol, and in vivo decrease in LDL levels in blood
(or plasma).
As used herein, the term "clinically meaningful" means at
least a 15% reduction in blood LDL-cholesterol levels in
humans or at least a 15%reduction in total blood cholesterol
in mice. It is clear that measurements in plasma or serum can
serve as surrogates for measurement of levels in blood.
As used herein, the term "PCSK9 antagonist peptide" or
"PCSK9 antagonist aptamer" includes any conventional pep-
tide or polypeptide or aptamer that blocks, antagonizes, sup-
presses or reduces (to any degree including significantly)
PCSK9 biological activity, including downstream pathways
mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction
and/or elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9. PCSK9
antagonist peptides or polypeptides include Fc fusions com-
prising the LDLR and soluble portions of the LDLR, or
mutants thereof with higher affinity to PCSK9.
The terms "polypeptide", "oligopeptide", "peptide" and
"protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to chains of
amino acids of any length, preferably, relatively short (e.g. ,
10-100amino acids). The chain may be linear or branched, it
may comprise modified amino acids, and/or may be inter-
rupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an
amino acid chain that has been modified naturally or by
intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glyco-
sylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any
other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with
a labeling component. Also included within the definition are,
for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of
an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino
US 9,175,093 B2
12
acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. It
is understood that the polypeptides can occur as single chains
or associated chains.
As known in the art, "polynucleotide, "or "nucleic acid,"as
used interchangeably herein, refer to chains ofnucleotides of
any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can
be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucle-
otides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can
be incorporated into a chain by DNA or RNA polymerase. A
polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as
methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modifi-
cation to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or
after assembly of the chain. The sequence ofnucleotides may
be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucle-
otide may be further modified after polymerization, such as
by conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of
modifications include, for example, "caps", substitution of
one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an
analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example,
those with uncharged linkages (e.g. , methyl phosphonates,
phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and
with charged linkages (e.g. , phosphorothioates, phospho-
rodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such
as, for example, proteins (e.g. , nucleases, toxins, antibodies,
signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators
(e.g. , acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators
(e.g. , metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals,
etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified link-
ages (e.g. , alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as
unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of
the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be
replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate
groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated
to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or
may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal
OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or
organic capping group moieties of from I to 20 carbon atoms.
Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protect-
ing groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous
forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally
known in the art, including, for example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-0-
allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs,
alpha- or beta-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as ara-
binose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars,
sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside ana-
logs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester
linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These
alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to,
embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O) S("thio-
ate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"), (O)NR~ ("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)
OR', CO or CH~ ("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is
independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20
C) optionally containing an ether (~ ) linkage, aryl, alk-
enyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a
polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description
applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including
RNA and DNA.
A "PCSK9 antagonist aptamer, "which comprises a nucleic
acid or protein sequence, is, for example, selected from a
large pool of random sequences and specifically binds
PCSK9. The nucleic acid of the aptamer is double-stranded
DNA or single-strand RNA. Nucleic acid aptamers can
include modified bases or functional groups, including but
not limited to 2'-fluorine nucleotides and 2'-0-methyl nucle-
otides. Aptamers can include hydrophilic polymers, for
example, polyethylene glycol. Aptamers may be made by

methods known in the art and selected for PCSK9 antagonist
activity by routine modification of the methods disclosed in
the Examples.
As used herein, an antibody, peptide, or aptamer "interacts
with" PCSK9 when the equilibrium dissociation constant is
equal to or less than 20 nM, preferably less than about 6 nM,
more preferably less than about I nM, most preferably less
than about 0.2 nM, as measured by the methods disclosed
herein in Example 2.
An epitope that "preferentially binds" or "specifically
binds" (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a
polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods
to determine such specific or preferential binding are also
well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit "specific
binding" or "preferential binding" if it reacts or associates
more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or
with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it
does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody "spe-
cifically binds" or "preferentially binds" to a target if it binds
with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater
duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an
antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to a PCSK9
epitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater
affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration
than it binds to other PCSK9 epitopes or non-PCSK9
epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that,
for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifi-
cally or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not
specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such,
"specific binding" or "preferential binding" does not neces-
sarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding.
Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means
preferential binding.
As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to material
which is at least 50% pure (ke. , free from contaminants),
more preferably, at least 90% pure, more preferably, at least
95% pure, yet more preferably, at least 98% pure, and most
preferably, at least 99% pure.
A "host cell" includes an individual cell or cell culture that
can be or has been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation
of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include progeny of a
single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be
completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA
complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, acci-
dental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells trans-
fected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.
As known in the art, the term "Fcregion" is used to define
a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The
"Fcregion" may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc
region. Although the boundaries ofthe Fc region ofan immu-
noglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy
chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino
acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the car-
boxyl-terminus thereof. The numbering of the residues in the
Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat. Kabat et al. ,
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.
Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Md. , 1991.The Fc region of an immunoglobulin
generally comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3.
As used in the art, "Fc receptor" and "FcR" describe a
receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The pre-
ferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a
preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma
receptor) and includes receptors of the FcIRI, Fcl RII, and
FcIRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alterna-
tively spliced forms of these receptors. FcIRII receptors
include Fcl RIIA (an "activating receptor") and Fcl RIIB (an
13
US 9,175,093 B2
14
"inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid
sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains
thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991,Ann.
Rev. Immunol. , 9:457-92; Capel et al. , 1994, Immu-
nomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al. , 1995, J. Lab. Clin.
Med. , 126:330-41."FcR"also includes the neonatal receptor,
FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs
to the fetus (Guyer et al. , 1976J. Immunol. , 117:587; and Kim
et al. , 1994, J. Immunol. , 24:249).
The term "compete", as used herein with regard to an
antibody, means that a first antibody, or an antigen-binding
portion thereof, binds to an epitope in a manner sufficiently
similar to the binding of a second antibody, or an antigen-
binding portion thereof, such that the result of binding of the
first antibody with its cognate epitope is detectably decreased
in the presence of the second antibody compared to the bind-
ing of the first antibody in the absence of the second antibody.
The alternative, where the binding of the second antibody to
its epitope is also detectably decreased in the presence of the
first antibody, can, but need not be the case. That is, a first
antibody can inhibit the binding of a second antibody to its
epitope without that second antibody inhibiting the binding of
the first antibody to its respective epitope. However, where
each antibody detectably inhibits the binding of the other
antibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the
same, greater, or lesser extent, the antibodies are said to
"cross-compete" with each other for binding of their respec-
tive epitope(s). Both competing and cross-competing anti-
bodies are encompassed by the present invention. Regardless
of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-com-
petition occurs (e.g. , steric hindrance, conformational
change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereof),
the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the teachings
provided herein, that such competing and/or cross-competing
antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the meth-
ods disclosed herein.
By an antibody with an epitope that "overlaps" with
another (second) epitope or with a surface on PCSK9 that
interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR is meant the
sharing of space in terms of the PCSK9 residues that are
interacted with. To calculate the percent of overlap, for
example, the percent overlap of the claimed antibody's
PCSK9 epitope with the surface of PCSK9 which interacts
with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR, the surface area of
PCSK9 buried when in complex with the LDLR is calculated
on a per-residue basis. The buried area is also calculated for
these residues in the PCSK9:antibody complex. To prevent
more than 100% possible overlap, surface area for residues
that have higher buried surface area in the PCSK9:antibody
complex than in LDLR:PCSK9 complex is set to values from
the LDLR:PCSK9 complex (100%).Percent surface overlap
is calculated by summing over all of the LDLR:PCSK9 inter-
acting residues and is weighted by the interaction area.
A "functional Fc region" possesses at least one effector
function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary "effector
functions" include Clq binding; complement dependent cyto-
toxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-medi-
ated cytotoxicity; phagocytosis; down-regulation of cell sur-
face receptors (e.g. , B cell receptor), etc. Such effector
functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with
a binding domain (e.g. , an antibody variable domain) and can
be assessed using various assays known in the art for evalu-
ating such antibody effector functions.
A "native sequence Fc region" comprises an amino acid
sequence identical to the amino acid sequence ofan Fc region
found in nature. A "variant Fc region" comprises an amino
acid sequence which differs from that ofa native sequence Fc

region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet
retains at least one effector function ofthe native sequence Fc
region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino
acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or
to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. , from about one
to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably, from
about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native
sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypep-
tide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at
least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc
region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and
most preferably, at least about 90% sequence identity there-
with, more preferably, at least about 95%, at least about 96%,
at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%
sequence identity therewith.
As used herein, "treatment" is an approach for obtaining
beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes of this
invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but
are not limited to, one or more of the following: enhancement
of LDL clearance and reducing incidence or amelioration of
aberrant cholesterol and/or lipoprotein levels resulting from
metabolic and/or eating disorders, or including familial
hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atheroscle-
rosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD).
"Reducing incidence" means any of reducing severity
(which can include reducing need for and/or amount of (e.g. ,
exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used for
this condition. As is understood by those skilled in the art,
individuals may vary in terms of their response to treatment,
and, as such, for example, a "method of reducing incidence"
reflects administering the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, pep-
tide, or aptamer based on a reasonable expectation that such
administration may likely cause such a reduction in incidence
in that particular individual.
"Ameliorating" means a lessening or improvement of one
or more symptoms as compared to not administering a
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. "Ameliorat-
ing" also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a
symptom.
As used herein, an "effective dosage" or "effective
amount" of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition
is an amount sufficient to effect any one or more beneficial or
desired results. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired
results include eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the
severity, or delaying the outset of the disease, including bio-
chemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the
disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phe-
notypes presenting during development of the disease. For
therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical
results such as reducing hypercholesterolemia or one or more
symptoms of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD, or coro-
nary heart disease, decreasing the dose of other medications
required to treat the disease, enhancing the effect of another
medication, and/or delaying the progression of the disease of
patients. An effective dosage can be administered in one or
more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an
effective dosage of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical com-
position is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or
therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is under-
stood in the clinical context, an effective dosage of a drug,
compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not
be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or
pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an "effective dosage"
may be considered in the context of administering one or
more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be consid-
15
US 9,175,093 B2
16
ered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with
one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is
achieved.
An "individual" or a "subject" is a mammal, more prefer-
ably, a human. Mammals also include, but are not limited to,
farm animals, sport animals, pets, primates, horses, dogs,
cats, mice and rats.
As used herein, "vector" means a construct, which is
capable of delivering, and, preferably, expressing, one or
more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell.
Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral
vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid,
cosmid or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors
associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or RNA
expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain
eukaryotic cells, such as producer cells.
As used herein, "expression control sequence" means a
nucleic acid sequence that directs transcription of a nucleic
acid. An expression control sequence can be a promoter, such
as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The
expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic
acid sequence to be transcribed.
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or
"pharmaceutical acceptable excipient" includes any material
which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the
ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive
with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are
not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers
such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions
such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting
agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral adminis-
tration are phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or normal (0.9%)
saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated
by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Rem-
ington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. Gennaro,
ed. , Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. , 1990;and Remington,
The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. , Mack Pub-
lishing, 2000).
The term "k ", as used herein, refers to the rate constant
for association of an antibody to an antigen. Specifically, the
rate constants (k and k +) and equilibrium dissociation con-
stants are measured using Fab antibody fragments (Le., uni-
valent) and PCSK9.
The term "k &', as used herein, refers to the rate constant
for dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen
complex.
The term "K~", as used herein, refers to the equilibrium
dissociation constant of an antibody-antigen interaction.
A. Methods for Preventing or Treating Disorders Associated
with Hypercholesterolemia
In one aspect, the invention provides a method for treating
or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one
symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary
heart disease, in an individual comprising administering to
the individual an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist
antibody or peptide or aptamer that antagonizes circulating
PCSK9.
In a further aspect, the invention provides an effective
amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer
that antagonizes circulating PCSK9 for use in treating or
preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one symp-
tom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary heart
disease, in an individual. The invention further provides the
use of an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody,
peptide, or aptamer that antagonizes extracellular or circulat-
ing PCSK9 in the manufacture ofa medicament for treating or

preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one symp-
tom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary heart
disease, in an individual.
Advantageously, therapeutic administration of the anti-
body, peptide, or aptamer results in lower blood cholesterol
and/or lower blood LDL. Preferably, blood cholesterol and/or
blood LDL is at least about 10% or 15% lower than before
administration. More preferably, blood cholesterol and/or
blood LDL is at least about 20% lower than before adminis-
tration ofthe antibody. Yet more preferably, blood cholesterol
and/or blood LDL is at least 30% lower than before admin-
istration of the antibody. Advantageously, blood cholesterol
and/or blood LDL is at least 40% lower than before admin-
istration of the antibody. More advantageously, blood choles-
terol and/or blood LDL is at least 50% lower than before
administration of the antibody. Very preferably, blood cho-
lesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 60% lower than before
administration of the antibody. Most preferably, blood cho-
lesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 70% lower than before
administration of the antibody.
With respect to all methods described herein, reference to
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, peptides, and aptamers also
include compositions comprising one or more additional
agents. These compositions may further comprise suitable
excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
including buffers, which are well known in the art. The
present invention can be used alone or in combination with
other conventional methods of treatment.
The PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can
be administered to an individual via any suitable route. It
should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the
examples described herein are not intended to be limiting but
to be illustrative of the techniques available. Accordingly, in
some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide,
or aptamer is administered to an individual in accord with
known methods, such as intravenous administration, e.g. , as a
bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerebrospinal, transder-
mal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, sublingually, intrasyn-
ovial, via insufflation, intrathecal, oral, inhalation or topical
routes. Administration can be systemic, e.g. , intravenous
administration, or localized. Commercially available nebu-
lizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers and
ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liquid
formulations can be directly nebulized and lyophilized pow-
der can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively,
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can be aero-
solized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a metered dose
inhaler, or inhaled as a lyophilized and milled powder.
In one embodiment, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, pep-
tide, or aptamer is administered via site-specific or targeted
local delivery techniques. Examples of site-specific or tar-
geted local delivery techniques include various implantable
depot sources of the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or
aptamer or local delivery catheters, such as infusion catheters,
indwelling catheters, or needle catheters, synthetic grafts,
adventitial wraps, shunts and stents or other implantable
devices, site specific carriers, direct injection, or direct appli-
cation. See, e.g. , PCT Publ. No. WO 00/53211 and U.S. Pat.
No. 5,981,568.
Various formulations of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody,
peptide, or aptamer may be used for administration. In some
embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or
aptamer may be administered neat. In some embodiments,
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer and a phar-
maceutically acceptable excipient may be in various formu-
lations. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are known in
17
US 9,175,093 B2
18
the art, and are relatively inert substances that facilitate
administration of a pharmacologically effective substance.
For example, an excipient can give form or consistency, or act
as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to
stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for
varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin
penetration enhancers. Excipients as well as formulations for
parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in
Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. ,
Mack Publishing (2000).
These agents can be combined with pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicles such as saline, Ringer's solution, dex-
trose solution, and the like. The particular dosage regimen,
i.e., dose, timing and repetition, will depend on the particular
individual and that individual's medical history.
PCSK9 antibodies can also be administered via inhalation,
as described herein. Generally, for administration of PCSK9
antibodies, an initial candidate dosage can be about 2 mg/kg.
For the purpose of the present invention, a typical daily dos-
age might range from about any of about 3 pg/kg to 30 pg/kg
to 300 pg/kg to 3 mg/kg, to 30 mg/kg, to 100 mg/kg or more,
depending on the factors mentioned above. For example,
dosage of about I mg/kg, about 2.5 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg,
about 10 mg/kg, and about 25 mg/kg may be used. For
repeated administrations over several days or longer, depend-
ing on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired
suppression of symptoms occurs or until sufficient therapeu-
tic levels are achieved, for example, to reduce blood LDL
levels. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administer-
ing an initial dose of about 2 mg/kg, followed by a weekly
maintenance dose of about I mg/kg of the PCSK9 antibody,
or followed by a maintenance dose of about I mg/kg every
other week. However, other dosage regimens may be useful,
depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the
practitioner wishes to achieve. For example, in some embodi-
ments, dosing from one to four times a week is contemplated.
In other embodiments dosing once a month or once every
other month or every three months is contemplated. The
progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional
techniques and assays. The dosing regimen (including the
PCSK9 antagonist(s) used) can vary over time.
For the purpose of the present invention, the appropriate
dosage of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer
will depend on the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or
aptamer (or compositions thereof) employed, the type and
severity of symptoms to be treated, whether the agent is
administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous
therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the
agent, the patient's blood PCSK9 levels, the patient' s synthe-
sis and clearance rate for PCSK9, the patient's clearance rate
for the administered agent, and the discretion of the attending
physician. Typically the clinician will administer a PCSK9
antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer until a dosage is
reached that achieves the desired result. Dose and/or fre-
quency can vary over course of treatment. Empirical consid-
erations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to the
determination of the dosage. For example, antibodies that are
compatible with the human immune system, such as human-
ized antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be used to
prolong half-life of the antibody and to prevent the antibody
being attacked by the host's immune system. Frequency of
administration may be determined and adjusted over the
course of therapy, and is generally, but not necessarily, based
on treatment and/or suppression and/or amelioration and/or
delay of symptoms, e.g. , hypercholesterolemia. Alterna-
tively, sustained continuous release formulations of PCSK9

antagonist antibodies may be appropriate. Various formula-
tions and devices for achieving sustained release are known in
the art.
In one embodiment, dosages for an antagonist antibody,
peptide, or aptamer may be determined empirically in indi-
viduals who have been given one or more administration(s) of
an antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. Individuals are
given incremental dosages of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody,
peptide, or aptamer. To assess efficacy, an indicator of the
disease can be followed.
Administration of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide,
or aptamer in accordance with the method in the present
invention can be continuous or intermittent, depending, for
example, upon the recipient's physiological condition,
whether the purpose of the administration is therapeutic or
prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled practitioners.
The administration of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide,
or aptamer may be essentially continuous over a preselected
period of time or may be in a series of spaced doses.
In some embodiments, more than one antagonist antibody,
peptide, or aptamer may be present. At least one, at least two,
at least three, at least four, at least five different, or more
antagonist antibodies and/or peptides can be present. Gener-
ally, those PCSK9 antagonist antibodies or peptides may have
complementary activities that do not adversely affect each
other. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can
also be used in conjunction with other PCSK9 antagonists or
PCS K9 receptor antagonists. For example, one or more of the
following PCSK9 antagonists may be used: an antisense mol-
ecule directed to a PCSK9 (including an anti-sense molecule
directed to a nucleic acid encoding PCSK9), a PCSK9 inhibi-
tory compound, and a PCSK9 structural analog. A PCSK9
antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can also be used in
conjunction with other agents that serve to enhance and/or
complement the effectiveness of the agents.
Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic
to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and
may comprise buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other
organic acids; salts such as sodium chloride; antioxidants
including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such
as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexam-
ethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium
chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens,
such as methyl orpropyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclo-
hexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight
(less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as
serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic
polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as
glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine;
monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates
including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents
such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or
sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal
complexes (e.g. , Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic
surfactants such as TWEEN, PLURONICS™or polyeth-
ylene glycol (PEG).
Liposomes containing the PCSK9 antagonist antibody,
peptide, or aptamer are prepared by methods known in the art,
such as described in Epstein, et al. , 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci.USA 82:3688;Hwang, et al. , 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 77:4030; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545.
Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in
U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. Particularly useful liposomes can be
generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a
lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, choles-
terol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-
19
US 9,175,093 B2
20
PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore
size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter.
The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcap-
sules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by
interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcel-
lulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacry-
late) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery
systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres,
microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in mac-
roemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington,
The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. , Mack Pub-
lishing (2000).
Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable
examples of sustained-release preparations include semiper-
meable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing
the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped
articles, e.g. , films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-
release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example,
poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or 'poly(vinylalcohol)),
polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of
L-glutamic acid and 7 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable
ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid
copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™(injectable
microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copoly-
mer and leuprolide acetate), sucrose acetate isobutyrate, and
poly-D-( —)-3-hydroxybutyrlc acid.
The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must
be sterile. This is readily accomplished by, for example, fil-
tration through sterile filtration membranes. Therapeutic
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer composi-
tions are generally placed into a container having a sterile
access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial
having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.
Suitable emulsions may be prepared using commercially
available fat emulsions, such as Intralipid™, Liposyn™,
Infonutrol™ Lipofundin™ and Lipiphysan™. The active
ingredient may be either dissolved in a pre-mixed emulsion
composition or alternatively it may be dissolved in an oil
(e.g. , soybean oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil,
corn oil or almond oil) and an emulsion formed upon mixing
with a phospholipid (e.g. , egg phospholipids, soybean phos-
pholipids or soybean lecithin) and water. It will be appreci-
ated that other ingredients may be added, for example glyc-
erol or glucose, to adjust the tonicity ofthe emulsion. Suitable
emulsions will typically contain up to 20% oil, for example,
between 5 and 20%. The fat emulsion can comprise fat drop-
lets between 0.1 and 1.0 pm, particularly 0.1 and 0.5 pm, and
have a pH in the range of 5.5 to 8.0.
The emulsion compositions can be those prepared by mix-
ing a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer with
Intralipid™ or the components thereof (soybean oil, egg
phospholipids, glycerol and water).
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solu-
tions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aque-
ous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders.
The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable phar-
maceutically acceptable excipients as set out above. In some
embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral
or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Com-
positions in preferably sterile pharmaceutically acceptable
solvents may be nebulised by use of gases. Nebulised solu-
tions may be breathed directly from the nebulising device or
the nebulising device may be attached to a face mask, tent or
intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,
suspension or powder compositions may be administered,
preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the
formulation in an appropriate manner.

B.PCSK9 Antagonists
The methods of the invention use a PCSK9 antagonist
antibody, peptide, or aptamer, which refers to any peptide or
nucleic acid molecule that blocks, suppresses or reduces (in-
cluding significantly reduces) PCSK9 biological activity,
including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signal-
ing, such as elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9.
A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer should
exhibit any one or more of the following characteristics: (a)
bind to PCSK9; (b) block PCSK9 interaction with the LDLR;
(c) block or decrease PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of
the LDLR; (d) inhibit the PCSK9-mediated decrease in LDL
blood clearance, (e) increase LDL clearance in media by
cultured hepatocytes, (fJ increase blood LDL clearance by the
liver in vivo, (g) sensitize to statins, and (h) block PCSK9
interaction with other yet to be identified factors.
For purposes of this invention, the antibody, peptide, or
aptamer preferably reacts with PCSK9 in a manner that inhib-
its PCSK9 signaling function and LDLR interaction. In some
embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody specifically
recognizes primate PCSK9. In some embodiments, the
PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds primate and rodent
PCSK9.
The antibodies useful in the present invention can encom-
pass monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, antibody
fragments (e.g. , Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, Fc, etc.), chimeric
antibodies, bispecific antibodies, heteroconjugate antibodies,
single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins com-
prising an antibody portion (e.g. , a domain antibody), human
antibodies, humanized antibodies, and any other modified
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that com-
prises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity,
including glycosylation variants of antibodies, amino acid
sequence variants of antibodies, and covalently modified
antibodies. The antibodies may be murine, rat, human, or any
other origin (including chimeric or humanized antibodies).
In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody is a
monoclonal antibody. The PCSK9 antagonist antibody can
also be humanized. In other embodiments, the antibody is
human.
In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a modified
constant region, such as a constant region that is immunologi-
cally inert, that is, having a reduced potential for provoking an
immune response. In some embodiments, the constant region
is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol. , 1999, 29:2613-
2624; PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; and/or UK Patent Appli-
cation No. 9809951.8. The Fc can be human IgG~ or human
IgG4. The Fc can be human IgG~ containing the mutation
A330P331 to S330S331 (IgG~~ ), in which the amino acid
residues are numbered with reference to the wild type IgG2
sequence. Eur. J. Immunol. , 1999, 29:2613-2624. In some
embodiments, the antibody comprises a constant region of
IgG4 comprising the following mutations (Armour et al. ,

to P233V234A235 (IgG«), in which the numbering is with
reference to wild type IgG4. In yet another embodiment, the
Fc is human IgG4 E233F234L235 to P233V234A235 with
deletion G236 (IgG«b). In another embodiment the Fc is any
human IgG4 Fc (IgG4, IgG«b or IgG«) containing hinge
stabilizing mutation S228 to P228 (Aalberse et al. , 2002,
Immunology 105, 9-19).In another embodiment, the Fc can
be aglycosylated Fc.
In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated
by mutating the oligosaccharide attachment residue (such as
Asn297) and/or flanking residues that are part of the glyco-
sylation recognition sequence in the constant region. In some
embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for
21

22
N-linked glycosylation enzymatically. The constant region
may be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymati-
cally or by expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell.
The binding affinity (K~) of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody
to PCSK9 (such as human PCSK9)) can be about 0.002 to
about 200 nM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is
any of about 200 nM, about 100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10
nM, about I nM, about 500 pM, about 100pM, about 60 pM,
about 50pM, about 20pM, about 15 pM, about 10pM, about
5 pM, or about 2 pM. In some embodiments, the binding
affinity is less than any of about 250 nM, about 200 nM, about
100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about I nM, about 500
pM, about 100pM, about 50 pM, about 20 pM, about 10pM,
about 5 pM, or about 2 pM.
One way of determining binding affinity of antibodies to
PCSK9 is by measuring binding affinity of monofunctional
Fab fragments of the antibody. To obtainmonofunctional Fab
fragments, an antibody (for example, IgG) can be cleaved
with papain or expressed recombinantly. The affinity of a
PCSK9 Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined by
surface plasmon resonance (Biacore3000™surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) system, Biacore, INC, Piscataway N.J.)
equipped with pre-immobilized streptavidin sensor chips
(SA) using HBS-EP running buffer (0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4,
0.15 NaCI, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20). Bioti-
nylated human PCSK9 (or any other PCSK9) can be diluted
into HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of less than 0.5 pg/mL
and injected across the individual chip channels using vari-
able contact times, to achieve two ranges of antigen density,
either 50-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies
or 800-1,000 RU for screening assays. Regeneration studies
have shown that 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol effectively
removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity of PCSK9
on the chip for over 200 injections. Typically, serial dilutions
(spanning concentrations of 0.1-10x estimated K~) of puri-
fied Fab samples are injected for I min at 100 pL/minute and
dissociation times of up to 2 hours are allowed. The concen-
trations of the Fab proteins are determined by ELISA and/or
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of known concentra-
tion (as determined by amino acid analysis) as a standard.
Kinetic association rates (k ) and dissociation rates (k +) are
obtained simultaneously by fitting the data globally to a I:I
Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam,
L. Petersson, B., 1994. Methods Enzymology 6. 99-110)
using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation
constant (K~) values are calculated as k + . This protocol
is suitable for use in determining binding affinity of an anti-
body to any PCSK9, including human PCSK9, PCSK9 of
another mammalian (such as mouse PCSK9, rat PCSK9,
primate PCSK9), as well as different forms of PCSK9 (such
as u and JJ form). Binding affinity of an antibody is generally
measured at 25' C., but can also be measured at 37' C.
The PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be made by any
method known in the art including the method as provided in
Example 1. The route and schedule of immunization of the
host animal are generally in keeping with established and
conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and pro-
duction, as further described herein. General techniques for
production of human and mouse antibodies are known in the
art and/or are described herein. A currently preferred method
of making the antibodies comprises the immunization of
PCSK9 knockout (PCSK9—/ —) animals as disclosed herein.
It is contemplated that any mammalian subject including
humans or antibody producing cells therefrom can be
manipulated to serve as the basis for production of mamma-
lian, including human, hybridoma cell lines. Typically, the
host animal is inoculated intraperitoneally, intramuscularly,

orally, subcutaneously, intraplantar, and/or intradermally
with an amount of immunogen, including as described herein.
Hybridomas can be prepared from the lymphocytes and
immortalized myeloma cells using the general somatic cell
hybridization technique of Kohler, B.and Milstein, C., 1975,
Nature 256:495-497 or as modified by Buck, D. W. , et al. ,
1982, In Vitro, 18:377-381.Available myeloma lines, includ-
ing but not limited to X63-Ag8.653 and those from the Salk
Institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. , USA,
may be used in the hybridization. Generally, the technique
involves fusing myeloma cells and lymphoid cells using a
fusogen such as polyethylene glycol, or by electrical means
well known to those skilled in the art. After the fusion, the
cells are separated from the fusion medium and grown in a
selective growth medium, such as hypoxanthine-aminop-
terin-thymidine (HAT) medium, to eliminate unhybridized
parent cells. Any of the media described herein, supple-
mented with or without serum, can be used for culturing
hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibodies. As another
alternative to the cell fusion technique, EBV immortalized B
cells may be used to produce the PCSK9 monoclonal anti-
bodies ofthe subject invention. The hybridomas are expanded
and subcloned, if desired, and supernatants are assayed for
anti-immunogen activity by conventional immunoassay pro-
cedures (e.g. , radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or
fluorescence immunoassay).
Hybridomas that may be used as a source of antibodies
encompass all derivatives, progeny cells of the parent hybri-
domas that produce monoclonal antibodies specific for
PCSK9, or a portion thereof.
Hybridomas that produce such antibodies may be grown in
vitro or in vivo using known procedures. The monoclonal
antibodies may be isolated from the culture media or body
fluids, by conventional immunoglobulin purification proce-
dures such as ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel electro-
phoresis, dialysis, chromatography, and ultrafiltration, if
desired. Undesired activity, if present, can be removed, for
example, by running the preparation over adsorbents made of
the immunogen attached to a solid phase and eluting or releas-
ing the desired antibodies off the immunogen. Immunization
of a host animal with a human PCSK9, or a fragment con-
taining the target amino acid sequence conjugated to a protein
that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g. ,
keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyro-
globulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or
derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuc-
cinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hy-
droxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde,
succinic anhydride, SOCI~, or R'N C NR, where R and
R' are different alkyl groups, can yield a population of anti-
bodies (e.g. , monoclonal antibodies).
Ifdesired, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody (monoclonal or
polyclonal) of interest may be sequenced and the polynucle-
otide sequence may then be cloned into a vector for expres-
sion or propagation. The sequence encoding the antibody of
interest may be maintained in vector in a host cell and the host
cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use. Produc-
tion ofrecombinant monoclonal antibodies in cell culture can
be carried out through cloning of antibody genes from Bcells
by means known in the art. See, e.g. , Tiller et al. , 2008, J.
Immunol. Methods 329, 112; U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,622.
In an alternative, the polynucleotide sequence may be used
for genetic manipulation to "humanize" the antibody or to
improve the affinity, or other characteristics of the antibody.
For example, the constant region may be engineered to more
nearly resemble human constant regions to avoid immune
response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and treat-
23
US 9,175,093 B2
24
ments in humans. It may be desirable to genetically manipu-
late the antibody sequence to obtain greater affinity to PCSK9
and greater efficacy in inhibiting PCSK9. It will be apparent
to one of skill in the art that one or more polynucleotide
changes can be made to the PCSK9 antagonist antibody and
still maintain its binding ability to PCSK9.
There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal
antibody. These are: (I) determining the nucleotide and pre-
dicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and
heavy variable domains; (2) designing the humanized anti-
body, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use
during the humanizing process; (3) the actual humanizing
methodologies/techniques; and (4) the transfection and
expression ofthe humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S.
Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331,415; 5,530,
101; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6, 180,370.
A number of "humanized" antibody molecules comprising
an antigen-binding site derived from a non-human immuno-
globulin have been described, including chimeric antibodies
having rodent or modified rodent V regions and their associ-
ated CDRs fused to human constant domains. See, for
example, Winter et al. , 1991,Nature 349:293-299;Lobuglio
et al. , 1989, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220-4224; Shaw
et al. , 1987, J. Immunol. 138:4534-4538; and Brown et al. ,
1987, Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583.Other references describe
rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting framework
region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human anti-
body constant domain. See, for example, Riechmann et al. ,
1988, Nature 332:323-327;Verhoeyen et al. , 1988, Science
239:1534-1536;and Jones et al. , 1986, Nature 321:522-525.
Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by
recombinantly engineered rodent framework regions. See,
for example, European Patent Publ. No. 0519596. These
"humanized" molecules are designed to minimize unwanted
immunological response toward rodent anti-human antibody
molecules which limits the duration and effectiveness of
therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipi-
ents. For example, the antibody constant region can be engi-
neered such that it is immunologically inert (e.g. , does not
trigger complement lysis). See, e.g. , PCT Publ. No. WO99/
58572; UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8. Other meth-
ods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized are
disclosed by Daugherty et al. , 1991, Nucl. Acids Res.
19:2471-2476 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297;
5,997,867; 5,866,692; 6,210,671; and 6,350,861; and in PCT
Publ. No. WO 01/27160.
In yet another alternative, fully human antibodies may be
obtained by using commercially available mice that have
been engineered to express specific human immunoglobulin
proteins. Transgenic animals that are designed to produce a
more desirable or more robust immune response may also be
used for generation of humanized or human antibodies.
Examples of such technology are Xenomouse™ from
Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif. ), HuMAb-Mouse and TC
Mouse™ from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.), and the
VelocImmune mouse from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Tarrytown, N.Y.).
In an alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly
and expressed using any method known in the art. In another
alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly by phage
display technology. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,
332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743; and 6,265, 150; and Winter et al. ,
1994, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-455.Alternatively, the
phage display technology (McCafferty et al. , 1990, Nature
348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibodies and
antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable
(V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors.

According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are
cloned in- frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene
of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and dis-
played as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the
phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a
single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections
based on the functional properties of the antibody also result
in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting
those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the prop-
erties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a
variety of formats; see, e.g. , Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell,
David J., 1993,Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-
571. Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for
phage display. Clackson et al. , 1991, Nature 352:624-628
isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a
small random combinatorial library ofV genes derived from
the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire ofV genes from
unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibod-
ies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can
be isolated essentially following the techniques described by
Mark et al. , 1991,J.Mol. Biol. 222:581-597, or Griffith et al. ,
1993, EMBO J. 12:725-734. In a natural immune response,
antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic
hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer
higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface
immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differenti-
ated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural pro-
cess can be mimicked by employing the technique known as
"chain shufiling. " (Marks et al. , 1992, Bio/Technol. 10:779-
783). In this method, the affinity of "primary" human anti-
bodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequen-
tially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with
repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V
domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This tech-
nique allows the production of antibodies and antibody frag-
ments with affinities in the pM-nM range. A strategy for
making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as
"the mother-of-all libraries" ) has been described by Water-
house et al. , 1993, Nucl. Acids Res. 21:2265-2266. Gene
shufiling can also be used to derive human antibodies from
rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar
affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody.
According to this method, which is also referred to as
"epitope imprinting", the heavy or light chain V domain gene
of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is
replaced with a repertoire ofhuman V domain genes, creating
rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in iso-
lation of human variable regions capable of restoring a func-
tional antigen-binding site, i.e., the epitope governs (im-
prints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in
order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human
antibody is obtained (see PCT Publ. No. WO 93/06213).
Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR
grafting, this technique provides completely human antibod-
ies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent
origin.
It is apparent that although the above discussion pertains to
humanized antibodies, the general principles discussed are
applicable to customizing antibodies for use, for example, in
dogs, cats, primate, equines and bovines. It is further apparent
that one or more aspects of humanizing an antibody described
herein may be combined, e.g. , CDR grafting, framework
mutation and CDR mutation.
Antibodies may be made recombinantly by first isolating
the antibodies and antibody producing cells from host ani-
mals, obtaining the gene sequence, and using the gene
sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in host cells
25
US 9,175,093 B2
26
(e.g. , CHO cells). Another method which may be employed is
to express the antibody sequence in plants (e.g. , tobacco) or
transgenic milk. Methods for expressing antibodies recombi-
nantly in plants or milk have been disclosed. See, for
example, Peeters, 2001, et al. Vaccine 19:2756;Lonberg, N.
and D. Huszar, 1995, Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65;and Pollock,
et al. , 1999, I Immunol Methods 231:147.Methods for mak-
ing derivatives of antibodies, e.g. , humanized, single chain,
etc. are known in the art.
Immunoassays and flow cytometry sorting techniques such
as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) can also be
employed to isolate antibodies that are specific for PCSK9.
The antibodies can be bound to many different carriers.
Carriers can be active and/or inert. Examples of well-known
carriers include polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene,
dextran, nylon, amylases, glass, natural and modified cellu-
loses, polyacrylamides, agaroses and magnetite. The nature
ofthe carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for purposes of
the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other
suitable carriers for binding antibodies, or will be able to
ascertain such, using routine experimentation. In some
embodiments, the carrier comprises a moiety that targets the
myocardium.
DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily iso-
lated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. , by
using oligonucleotide probes that are capable ofbinding spe-
cifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the
monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a pre-
ferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be
placed into expression vectors (such as expression vectors
disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462), which are then
transfected into host cells such as E. co/i cells, simian COS
cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells
that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to
obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recom-
binant host cells. See, e.g. , PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. The
DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the
coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant
domains in place of the homologous murine sequences, Mor-
rison et al. , 1984, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81:6851, or by
covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence
all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin
polypeptide. In that manner, "chimeric" or "hybrid" antibod-
ies are prepared that have the binding specificity of a PCSK9
monoclonal antibody herein.
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies and polypeptides derived
from antibodies can be identified or characterized using
methods known in the art, whereby reduction, amelioration,
or neutralization of PCSK9 biological activity is detected
and/or measured. In some embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist
antibody or polypeptide is identified by incubating a candi-
date agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and/or atten-
dant reduction or neutralization of a biological activity of
PCSK9. The binding assay may be performed with purified
PCSK9 polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or
trans fected to express, PCSK9 polypeptide(s). In one
embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding
assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete
with a known PCSK9 antagonist for PCSK9 binding is evalu-
ated. The assay may be performed in various formats, includ-
ing the ELISA format. In other embodiments, a PCSK9
antagonist antibody is identified by incubating a candidate
agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and attendant
inhibition of LDLR expression and/or blood cholesterol
clearance.
Following initial identification, the activity of a candidate
PCSK9 antagonist antibody can be further confirmed and

refined by bioassays that are known to test the targeted bio-
logical activities. Alternatively, bioassays can be used to
screen candidates directly. Some of the methods for identi fy-
ing and characterizing PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, pep-
tides, or aptamers are described in detail in the Examples.
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be characterized using
methods well known in the art. For example, one method is to
identify the epitope to which it binds, or "epitope mapping.
"
There are many methods known in the art for mapping and
characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including
solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex,
competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and
synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in
Chapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Labo-
ratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold
Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999).In an additional example, epitope
mapping can be used to determine the sequence to which a
PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds. Epitope mapping is com-
mercially available from various sources, for example, Pep-
scan Systems (Edelhertweg 15, 8219 PH Lelystad, The Neth-
erlands). The epitope can be a linear epitope, i.e., contained in
a single stretch of amino acids, or a conformational epitope
formed by a three-dimensional interaction of amino acids that
may not necessarily be contained in a single stretch. Peptides
ofvarying lengths (e.g. , at least 4-6 amino acids long) can be
isolated or synthesized (e.g. , recombinantly) and used for
binding assays with a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. In another
example, the epitope to which the PCSK9 antagonist anti-
body binds can be determined in a systematic screening by
using overlapping peptides derived from the PCSK9
sequence and determining binding by the PCSK9 antagonist
antibody. According to the gene fragment expression assays,
the open reading frame encoding PCSK9 is fragmented either
randomly or by specific genetic constructions and the reac-
tivity of the expressed fragments ofPCSK9 with the antibody
to be tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for
example, be produced by PCR and then transcribed and trans-
lated into protein in vitro, in the presence ofradioactive amino
acids. The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled
PCSK9 fragments is then determined by immunoprecipita-
tion and gel electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be
identified by using large libraries of random peptide
sequences displayed on the surface ofphage particles (phage
libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping pep-
tide fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in
simple binding as says. In an additional example, mutagenesi s
ofan antigen binding domain, domain swapping experiments
and alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to iden-
tify residues required, sufficient, and/or necessary for epitope
binding. For example, domain swapping experiments can be
performed using a mutant PCSK9 in which various fragments
of the PCSK9 polypeptide have been replaced (swapped)
with sequences from PCSK9 from another species, or a
closely related, but antigenically distinct protein (such as
another member of the proprotein convertase family). By
assessing binding of the antibody to the mutant PCSK9, the
importance of the particular PCSK9 fragment to antibody
binding can be assessed.
Yet another method which can be used to characterize a
PCSK9 antagonist antibody is to use competition assays with
other antibodies known to bind to the same antigen, i.e.,
various fragments on PCSK9, to determine if the PCSK9
antagonist antibody binds to the same epitope as other anti-
bodies. Competition assays are well known to those of skill in
the art.
The crystal structure of the antibody and antibody:antigen
complex can also be used to characterize the antibody. The
27
US 9,175,093 B2
28
residues are identified by calculating the difference in acces-
sible surface area between the LIL3:PCSK9 crystal structure
and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that show buried
surface area upon complex formation with LIL3 antibody are
included as a part of the epitope. The solvent accessible
surface of a protein is defined as the locus of the centre of a
probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 1.4 A.
radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface ofthe protein.
The solvent accessible surface area is calculated by generat-
ing surface points on an extended sphere about each atom (at
a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom
and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equiva-
lent spheres associated with neighboring atoms as imple-
mented in program AREAIMOL (Brlggs, P.J., 2000, CCP4
Newsletter No. 38, CCLRC, Daresbury).
An expression vector can be used to direct expression of a
PCSK9 antagonist antibody. One skilled in the art is familiar
with administration of expression vectors to obtain expres-
sion ofan exogenous protein in vivo. See, e.g. , U.S. Pat. Nos.
6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471. Administration of
expression vectors includes local or systemic administration,
including injection, oral administration, particle gun or cath-
eterized administration, and topical administration. In
another embodiment, the expression vector is administered
directly to the sympathetic trunk or ganglion, or into a coro-
nary artery, atrium, ventrical, or pericardium.
Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions containing
an expression vector, or subgenomic polynucleotides can also
be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery techniques are
described in, for example, Findeis et al. , 1993, Trends Bio-
technol. 11:202; Chiou et al. , 1994, Gene Therapeutics:
Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer (J. A.
Wolff, ed.); Wu et al. , 1988, J.Biol. Chem. 263:621;Wu et al. ,
1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:542; Zenke et al. , 1990, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 87:3655; Wu et al. , 1991, J. Biol. Chem.
266:338.Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucle-
otide are administered in a range ofabout 100ng to about 200
mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy proto-
col. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg,
about I pg to about 2 mg, about 5 pg to about 500 pg, and
about 20 pg to about 100 pg of DNA can also be used during
a gene therapy protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides and
polypeptides can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles.
The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin
(see generally, Jolly, 1994, Cancer Gene Therapy I:51;
Kimura, 1994, Human Gene Therapy 5:845; Connelly, 1995,
Human Gene Therapy I:185; and Kaplitt, 1994, Nature
Genetics 6:148).Expression of such coding sequences can be
induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous pro-
moters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either
constitutive or regulated.
Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucle-
otide and expression in a desired cell are well known in the art.
Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited
to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e.g. , PCT Publ. Nos. WO
90/07936; WO 94/03622; WO 93/25698; WO 93/25234; WO
93/11230; WO 93/10218; WO 91/02805; U.S. Pat. Nos.
5,219,740 and 4,777,127; GB Patent No. 2,200,651; and EP

The invention also provides CDR portions of antibodies to
PCSK9 (including Chothia and Kabat CDRs). Determination
of CDR regions is well within the skill of the art. It is under-
stood that in some embodiments, CDRs can be a combination
of the Kabat and Chothia CDR (also termed "combined
CDRs" or "extended CDRs"). In some embodiments, the
CDRs are the Kabat CDRs. In other embodiments, the CDRs
are the Chothia CDRs. In other words, in embodiments with
more than one CDR, the CDRs may be any ofKabat, Chothia,
combination CDRs, or combinations thereof.
The invention also provides methods of making any of
these antibodies or polypeptides. The antibodies ofthis inven-
tion can be made by procedures known in the art. The
polypeptides can be produced by proteolytic or other degra-
dation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods (ke. , single
or fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical
synthesis. Polypeptides of the antibodies, especially shorter
polypeptides up to about 50 amino acids, are conveniently
made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical synthesis
are known in the art and are commercially available. For
example, an antibody could be produced by an automated
polypeptide synthesizer employing the solid phase method.
See also, U.S.Pat. Nos. 5,807,715;4,816,567; and 6,331,415.
In another alternative, the antibodies and peptides can be
made recombinantly using procedures that are well known in
the art. In one embodiment, a polynucleotide comprises a
sequence encoding the heavy chain and/or the light chain
variable regions of antibody 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, 7D4 or LIL3.
The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may be main-
tained in a vector in a host cell and the host cell can then be
expanded and frozen for future use. Vectors (including
expression vectors) and host cells are further described
herein.
The invention also encompasses scFv of antibodies of this
invention. Single chain variable region fragments are made
by linking light and/or heavy chain variable regions by using
a short linking peptide. Bird et al. , 1988, Science 242:423-
426. An example of a linking peptide is (GGGGS)3 (SEQ ID
NO:24), which bridges approximately 3.5 nm between the
carboxy terminus of one variable region and the amino ter-
minus of the other variable region. Linkers ofother sequences
have been designed and used. Bird et al. , 1988, supra. Linkers
should be short, flexible polypeptides and preferably com-
prised of less than about 20 amino acid residues. Linkers can
45 in turn be modified for additional functions, such as attach-
ment of drugs or attachment to solid supports. The single
chain variants can be produced either recombinantly or syn-
thetically. For synthetic production of scFv, an automated
synthesizer can be used. For recombinant production of scFv,
50 a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes the
scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukary-
otic, such as yeast, plant, insect or mammalian cells, or
prokaryotic, such as E. co/i. Polynucleotides encoding the
scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as
55 ligationofpolynucleotides. TheresultantscFvcanbeisolated
using standard protein purification techniques known in the
art.
Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies
are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific anti-
60 bodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single
polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow
for pairing between the two domains on the same chain,
thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary
domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding
65 sites (see e.g. , Holliger, P. , et al. , 1993,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. , 1994, Structure
2:1121-1123).

For example, bispecific antibodies, monoclonal antibodies
that have binding specificities for at least two different anti-
gens, can be prepared using the antibodies disclosed herein.
Methods for making bi specifi antibodies are known in the art
(see, e.g. , Suresh et al. , 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:
210).Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific
antibodies was based on the coexpression of two immunoglo-
bulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, with the two heavy chains
having different specificities (Millstein and Cuello, 1983,
Nature 305, 537-539).
According to one approach to making bispecific antibod-
ies, antibody variable domains with the desired binding speci-
ficities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to
immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion
preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant
domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3
regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant
region (CHI), containing the site necessary for light chain
binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding
the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the
immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate
expression vectors, and are cotrans fected into a suitable host
organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the
mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in
embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide
chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It
is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or
all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the
expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios
results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular
significance.
In one approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of
a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding
specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy
chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specific-
ity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure, with an
immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific
molecule, facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific
compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combina-
tions. This approach is described in PCT Publ. No. WO
94/04690.
Heteroconjugate antibodies, comprising two covalently
joined antibodies, are also within the scope of the invention.
Such antibodies have been used to target immune system cells
to unwanted cells (U.S.Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment
of HIV infection (PCT Publ. Nos. WO 91/00360 and WO
92/200373; EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be
made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable
cross-linking agents and techniques are well known in the art,
and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.
Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared in
vitro using known methods of synthetic protein chemistry,
including those involving cross-linking agents. For example,
immunotoxins may be constructed using a di sulfid exchange
reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable
reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-
4-merc aptobutyrimi date.
Humanized antibody comprising one or more CDRs of
antibodies 5AIO or 7D4 or one or more CDRs derived from
antibodies 5AI0 or 7D4 can be made, for example, using any
methods know in the art. For example, four general steps may
be used to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (I)
determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid
sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable
domains; (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding
which antibody framework region to use during the human-
izing process; (3) using the actual humanizing methodolo-

gies/techniques; and (4) transfecting and expressing the
humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,
567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; 6,331,415; 5,530,101;5,693,761;
5,693,762; 5,585,089; and 6,180,370.
In the recombinant humanized antibodies, the Fc portion
can be modified to avoid interaction with Fc7 receptor and the
complement and immune systems. The techniques for prepa-
ration of such antibodies are described in WO 99/58572. For
example, the constant region may be engineered to more
resemble human constant regions to avoid immune response
if the antibody is used in clinical trials and treatments in
humans. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,997,867 and
5,866,692.
Humanized antibody comprising the light or heavy chain
variable regions or one or more CDRs of an antibody or its
variants shown in Table I, or one or more CDRs derived from
the antibody or its variants shown in Table 2 can be made
using any methods known in the art.
Humanized antibodies may be made by any method known
in the art.
The invention encompasses modifications to the antibodies
and polypeptides of the invention variants shown in Table I,
including functionally equivalent antibodies which do not
significantly affect their properties and variants which have
enhanced or decreased activity and/or affinity. For example,
the amino acid sequence may be mutated to obtain an anti-
body with the desired binding affinity to PCSK9. Modifica-
tion ofpolypeptides is routine practice in the art and need not
be described in detail herein. Modification ofpolypeptides is
exemplified in the Examples. Examples ofmodified polypep-
tides include polypeptides with conservative substitutions of
amino acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of
amino acids which do not significantly deleteriously change
the functional activity, or which mature (enhance) the affinity
of the polypeptide for its ligand, or use of chemical analogs.
Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or
carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue
to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as
well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino
acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an
antibody with an ¹erminal methionyl residue or the anti-
body fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the
antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus
of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which
increases the half-life of the antibody in the blood circulation.
Substitution variants have at least one amino acid residue
in the antibody molecule removed and a different residue
inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substi-
tutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but
FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitu-
tions are shown in Table 2 under the heading of "conservative
substitutions. "If such substitutions result in a change in bio-
logical activity, then more substantial changes, denominated
"exemplary substitutions" in Table 2, or as further described
below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced
and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the
antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that
differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the struc-
ture of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitu-
tion, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the
charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or
(c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are
divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:
(I) Non-polar: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;
(2) Polar without charge: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;
(3)Acidic (negatively charged): Asp, Glu;
(4) Basic (positively charged): Lys, Arg;
(5) Residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and
(6) Aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe, His.
Non-conservative substitutions are made by exchanging a
member of one of these classes for another class.
Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the
proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted,
generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the
molecule and prevent aberrant cross-linking. Conversely,
cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its
stability, particularly where the antibody is an antibody frag-
ment such as an Fv fragment.
Amino acid modifications can range from changing or
modifying one or more amino acids to complete redesign of a
region, such as the variable region. Changes in the variable
region can alter binding affinity and/or specificity. In some
embodiments, no more than one to five conservative amino
acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In other
embodiments, no more than one to three conservative amino
acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In still
other embodiments, the CDR domain is CDR H3 and/or CDR
L3.
Modifications also include glycosylated and nonglycosy-
lated polypeptides, as well as polypeptides with other post-
translational modifications, such as, for example, glycosyla-
tion with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation.
Antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their
constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, 1997, Chem. Immunol.
65:111-128;Wright and Morrison, 1997, TibTECH 15:26-
32).The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins
affect the protein's function (Boyd et al. , 1996, Mol. Immu-
nol. 32:1311-1318;Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Biochem.
29:4175-4180) and the intramolecular interaction between

portions of the glycoprotein, which can affect the conforma-
tion and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycopro-
tein (Jefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 1996, Cur-
rent Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also
serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based
upon specific recognition structures. Glycosylation of anti-
bodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with
tetracycline-regulated expression of JJ(1,4)-N-acetylglu-
cosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase
catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to
have improved ADCC activity (Umana et al. , 1999, Nature
Biotech. 17:176-180).
Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or
0-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohy-
drate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The
tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine, asparagine-X-
threonine, and asparagine-X-cysteine, where X is any amino
acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzy-
matic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the aspar-
agine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripep-
tide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential
glycosylation site. 0-linked glycosylation refers to the
attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine,
galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly
serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxy-
lysine may also be used.
Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conve-
niently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence
such that it contains one or more of the above-described
tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The
alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution
by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of
the original antibody (for 0-linked glycosylation sites).
The glycosylation pattern ofantibodies may also be altered
without altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glyco-
sylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the
antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombi-
nant glycoproteins, e.g. , antibodies, as potential therapeutics
is rarely the native cell, variations in the glyco syl ation pattern
of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g. , Hse et al. , 1997,
J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070).
In addition to the choice of host cells, factors that affect
glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies
include growth mode, media formulation, culture density,
oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various
methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern
achieved in a particular host organism including introducing
or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccha-
ride production (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261 and
5,278,299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation,
can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for
example, using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), N-glycosidase
F, endoglycosidase F I, endoglycosidase F2, endoglycosidase
F3. In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically
engineered to be defective in processing certain types of
polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well
known in the art.
Other methods of modification include using coupling
techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to,
enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation.
Modifications can be used, for example, for attachment of
labels for immunoassay. Modified polypeptides are made
using established procedures in the art and can be screened
using standard assays known in the art, some of which are
described below and in the Examples.

In some embodiments of the invention, the antibody com-
prises a modified constant region, such as a constant region
that is immunologically inert or partially inert, e.g. , does not
trigger complement mediated lysis, does not stimulate
ADCC, or does not activate microglia; or have reduced activi-
ties (compared to the unmodified antibody) in any one or
more ofthe following: triggering complement mediated lysis,
stimulating ADCC, or activating microglia. Different modi-
fications of the constant region may be used to achieve opti-
mal level and/or combination of effector functions. See, for
example, Morgan et al. , 1995, Immunology 86:319-324;
Lund et al. , 1996, J. Immunology 157:4963-9 157:4963-
4969; Idusogie et al. , 2000, J. Immunology 164:4178-4184;
Tao et al. , 1989, J. Immunology 143:2595-2601; and Jefferis
et al. , 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:59-76. In some
embodiments, the constant region is modified as described in
Eur. J. Immunol. , 1999, 29:2613-2624; PCT Publ. No.
WO99/58572; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951.8.
In other embodiments, the antibody comprises a human
heavy chain IgG2 constant region comprising the following
mutations: A330P331 to S330S331 (amino acid numbering
with reference to the wild type IgG2 sequence). Eur. J. Immu-
nol. , 1999, 29:2613-2624. In still other embodiments, the
constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation.
In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated
for N-linked glycosylation by mutating the glycosylated
amino acid residue or flanking residues that are part of the
N-glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region.
For example, N-glycosylation site N297 may be mutated to A,
Q, K, or H. See, Tao et al. , 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595-
2601; and Jefferis et al. , 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:
59-76. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglyco-
sylated for N-linked glycosylation. The constant region may
be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically
(such as removing carbohydrate by enzyme PNGase), or by
expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell.
Other antibody modifications include antibodies that have
been modified as described in PCT Publ. No. WO 99/58572.
These antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding domain
directed at the target molecule, an effector domain having an
amino acid sequence substantially homologous to all or part
of a constant domain of a human immunoglobulin heavy
chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the target
molecule without triggering significant complement depen-
dent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of the target. In some
embodiments, the effector domain is capable of specifically
binding FcRn and/or Fc7RIIb. These are typically based on
chimeric domains derived from two or more human immu-
noglobulin heavy chain C~2 domains. Antibodies modified in
this manner are particularly suitable for use in chronic anti-
body therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reac-
tions to conventional antibody therapy.
The invention includes affinity matured embodiments. For
example, affinity matured antibodies can be produced by
procedures known in the art (Marks et al. , 1992, Bio/Tech-
nology, 10:779-783;Barbas et al. , 1994, Proc Nat. Acad. Sci,
USA 91:3809-3813;Schier et al. , 1995, Gene, 169:147-155;
Yelton et al. , 1995, J. Immunol. , 155:1994-2004;Jackson et
al. , 1995, J. Immunol. , 154(7):3310-9;Hawkins et al. , 1992,
J. Mol. Biol. , 226:889-896; and PCT Publ. No. WO2004/
058184).
The following methods may be used for adjusting the affin-
ity of an antibody and for characterizing a CDR. One way of
characterizing a CDR of an antibody and/or altering (such as
improving) the binding affinity of a polypeptide, such as an
antibody, termed "library scanning mutagenesis". Generally,
library scanning mutagenesis works as follows. One or more

amino acid positions in the CDR are replaced with two or
more (such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, or 20) amino acids using art recognized methods. This
generates small libraries of clones (in some embodiments,
one for every amino acid position that is analyzed), each with
a complexity of two or more members (if two or more amino
acids are substituted at every position). Generally, the library
also includes a clone comprising the native (unsubstituted)
amino acid. A small number of clones, e.g. , about 20-80
clones (depending on the complexity of the library), from
each library are screened for binding affinity to the target
polypeptide (or other binding target), and candidates with
increased, the same, decreased, or no binding are identified.
Methods for determining binding affinity are well-known in
the art. Binding affinity may be determined using Biacore
surface plasmon resonance analysis, which detects differ-
ences in binding affinity of about 2-fold or greater. Biacore is
particularly useful when the starting antibody already binds
with a relatively high affinity, for example a K~ of about 10
nM or lower. Screening using Biacore surface plasmon reso-
nance is described in the Examples, herein.
Binding affinity may be determined using Kinexa Biocen-
sor, scintillation proximity assays, ELISA, ORIGEN immu-
noassay (IGEN), fluorescence quenching, fluorescence trans-
fer, and/or yeast display. Binding affinity may also be
screened using a suitable bioassay.
In some embodiments, every amino acid position in a CDR
is replaced (in some embodiments, one at a time) with all 20
natural amino acids using art recognized mutagenesis meth-
ods (some of which are described herein). This generates
small libraries ofclones (in some embodiments, one for every
amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity
of 20 members (if all 20 amino acids are substituted at every
position).
In some embodiments, the library to be screened comprises
substitutions in two or more positions, which may be in the
same CDR or in two or more CDRs. Thus, the library may
comprise substitutions in two or more positions in one CDR.
The library may comprise substitution in two or more posi-
tions in two or more CDRs. The library may comprise sub-
stitution in 3, 4, 5, or more positions, said positions found in
two, three, four, five or six CDRs. The substitution may be
prepared using low redundancy codons. See, e.g. , Table 2 of
Balint et al. , 1993, Gene 137(1):109-18).
The CDR may be CDRH3 and/or CDRL3. The CDR may
be one or more of CDRLI, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRHI,
CDRH2, and/or CDRH3. The CDR may be a Kabat CDR, a
Chothia CDR, or an extended CDR.
Candidates with improved binding may be sequenced,
thereby identifying a CDR substitution mutant which results
in improved affinity (also termed an "improved" substitu-
tion). Candidates that bind may also be sequenced, thereby
identifying a CDR substitution which retains binding.
Multiple rounds of screening may be conducted. For
example, candidates (each comprising an amino acid substi-
tution at one or more position of one or more CDR) with
improved binding are also useful for the design of a second
library containing at least the original and substituted amino
acid at each improved CDR position (ke. , amino acid position
in the CDR at which a substitution mutant showed improved
binding). Preparation, screening, and selection of this library
is discussed further below.
Library scanning mutagenesis also provides a means for
characterizing a CDR, in so far as the frequency of clones
with improved binding, the same binding, decreased binding
or no binding also provide information relating to the impor-
tance of each amino acid position for the stability of the
37
US 9,175,093 B2
38
antibody-antigen complex. For example, if a position of the
CDR retains binding when changed to a1120 amino acids, that
position is identified as a position that is unlikely to be
required for antigen binding. Conversely, if a position ofCDR
retains binding in only a small percentage of substitutions,
that position is identified as a position that is important to
CDR function. Thus, the library scanning mutagenesis meth-
ods generate information regarding positions in the CDRs
that can be changed to many different amino acids (including
all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which cannot
be changed or which can only be changed to a few amino
acids.
Candidates with improved affinity may be combined in a
second library, which includes the improved amino acid, the
original amino acid, and may further include additional sub-
stitutions at that position, depending on the complexity of the
library that is desired, or permitted using the desired screen-
ing or selection method. In addition, if desired, and adjacent
amino acid position can be randomized to at least two or more
amino acids. Randomization of adjacent amino acids may
permit additional conformational flexibility in the mutant
CDR, which may, in turn, permit or facilitate the introduction
of a larger number of improving mutations. The library may
also comprise substitution at positions that did not show
improved affinity in the first round of screening.
The second library is screened or selected for library mem-
bers with improved and/or altered binding affinity using any
method known in the art, including screening using Biacore
surface plasmon resonance analysis, and selection using any
method known in the art for selection, including phage dis-
play, yeast display, and ribosome display.
The invention also encompasses fusion proteins compris-
ing one or more fragments or regions from the antibodies or
polypeptides of this invention. In one embodiment, a fusion
polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10 contiguous
amino acids ofa variable light chain region shown in SEQ ID
NOs: 53, 16, 17, 18, or 19 and/or at least 10 amino acids of a
variable heavy chain region shown in SEQ ID NOs: 54, 20,
21, 22, or 23. In other embodiments, a fusion polypeptide is
provided that comprises at least about 10, at least about 15, at
least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 contigu-
ous amino acids of the variable light chain region and/or at
least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least
about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of the
variable heavy chain region. In another embodiment, the
fusion polypeptide comprises a light chain variable region
and/or a heavy chain variable region, as shown in any of the
sequence pairs selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 53 and 54,
16 and 20, 17 and 21, 18 and 22, and 19 and 23. In another
embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises one or more
CDR(s). In still other embodiments, the fusion polypeptide
comprises CDR H3 (VH CDR3) and/or CDR L3 (VL CDR3).
For purposes of this invention, a fusion protein contains one
or more antibodies and another amino acid sequence to which
it is not attached in the native molecule, for example, a het-
erologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another
region. Exemplary heterologous sequences include, but are
not limited to a "tag" such as a FLAG tag or a 6H is tag. Tags
are well known in the art.
A fusion polypeptide can be created by methods known in
the art, for example, synthetically or recombinantly. Typi-
cally, the fusion proteins of this invention are made by pre-
paring an expressing a polynucleotide encoding them using
recombinant methods described herein, although they may
also be prepared by other means known in the art, including,
for example, chemical synthesis.

This invention also provides compositions comprising
antibodies or polypeptides conjugated (for example, linked)
to an agent that facilitate coupling to a solid support (such as
biotin or avidin). For simplicity, reference will be made gen-
erally to antibodies with the understanding that these methods
apply to any ofthe PCSK9 binding and/or antagonist embodi-
ments described herein. Conjugation generally refers to link-
ing these components as described herein. The linking (which
is generally fixing these components in proximate association
at least for administration) can be achieved in any number of
ways. For example, a direct reaction between an agent and an
antibody is possible when each possesses a substituent
capable of reacting with the other. For example, a nucleo-
philic group, such as an amino or sulfhydryl group, on one
may be capable ofreacting with a carbonyl-containing group,
such as an anhydride or an acid halide, or with an alkyl group
containing a good leaving group (e.g. , a halide) on the other.
An antibody or polypeptide of this invention may be linked
to a labeling agent such as a fluorescent molecule, a radioac-
tive molecule or any others labels known in the art. Labels are
known in the art which generally provide (either directly or
indirectly) a signal.
The invention also provides compositions (including phar-
maceutical compositions) and kits comprising, as this disclo-
sure makes clear, any or all of the antibodies and/or polypep-
tides described herein.
The invention also provides isolated polynucleotides
encoding the antibodies and peptides of the invention, and
vectors and host cells comprising the polynucleotide.
Accordingly, the invention provides polynucleotides (or
compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions),
comprising polynucleotides encoding any of the following:
the antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, 7D4, LIL3, or any fragment
or part thereof having the ability to antagonize PCSK9.
In another aspect, the invention provides polynucleotides
encoding any of the antibodies (including antibody frag-
ments) and polypeptides described herein, such as antibodies
and polypeptides having impaired effector function. Poly-
nucleotides can be made and expressed by procedures known
in the art.
In another aspect, the invention provides compositions
(such as pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any of the
polynucleotides of the invention. In some embodiments, the
composition comprises an expression vector comprising a
polynucleotide encoding the antibody as described herein. In
other embodiment, the composition comprises an expression
vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding any of the anti-
bodies or polypeptides described herein. In still other
embodiments, the composition comprises either or both of the
polynucleotides shown in SEQ ID NO:25 and SEQ ID
NO:26. Expression vectors, and administration ofpolynucle-
otide compositions are further described herein.
In another aspect, the invention provides a method ofmak-
ing any of the polynucleotides described herein.
Polynucleotides complementary to any such sequences are
also encompassed by the present invention. Polynucleotides
may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-
stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or
RNA molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules,
which contain introns and correspond to a DNA molecule in
a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do not
contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences
may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the
present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be
linked to other molecules and/or support materials.
Polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (Le., an
endogenous sequence that encodes an antibody or a portion
39
US 9,175,093 B2
40
thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Poly-
nucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, addi-
tions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immunoreac-
tivity ofthe encoded polypeptide is not diminished, relative to
a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on the immu-
noreactivity of the encoded polypeptide may generally be
assessed as described herein. Variants preferably exhibit at
least about 70% identity, more preferably, at least about 80%
identity, yet more preferably, at least about 90% identity, and
most preferably, at least about 95% identity to a polynucle-
otide sequence that encodes a native antibody or a portion
thereof.
Two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to
be "identical" if the sequence ofnucleotides or amino acids in
the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum
correspondence as described below. Comparisons between
two sequences are typically performed by comparing the
sequences over a comparison window to identify and com-
pare local regions of sequence similarity. A "comparison
window" as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about
20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, or 40 to about
50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference
sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after
the two sequences are optimally aligned.
Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be
conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite
of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc. , Madison,
Wis. ), using default parameters. This program embodies sev-
eral alignment schemes described in the following refer-
ences: Dayhoff, M. O., 1978,A model of evolutionary change
in proteins Matrices for detecting distant relationships. In
Dayho ff, M. O. (ed.)Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure
(National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington
D.C.), Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-358; Hein J., 1990, Unified
Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 626-645 Meth-
ods in Enzymology vol. 183, (Academic Press, Inc. , San
Diego, Calif. ); Higgins, D. G. and Sharp, P. M. , 1989,

onomy (Freeman Press, San Francisco, Calif. ); Wilbur, W. J.
and Lipman, D. J., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:726-
730.
Preferably, the "percentage of sequence identity" is deter-
mined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a
window of comparison of at least 20 positions, wherein the
portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the
comparison window may comprise additions or deletions
(i.e., gaps) of20 percent or less, usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10
to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which
does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal align-
ment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by
determining the number of positions at which the identical
nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both
sequences to yield the number ofmatched positions, dividing
the number of matched positions by the total number of
positions in the reference sequence (i.e. the window size) and
multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of
sequence identity.
Variants may also, or alternatively, be substantially
homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement
thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybrid-
izing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally
occurring DNA sequence encoding a native antibody (or a
complementary sequence).

Suitable "moderately stringent conditions" include pre-
washing in a solution of 5xSSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50' C.-65' C., 5xSSC, overnight;
followed by washing twice at 65' C. for 20 minutes with each
of 2x, 0.5x and 0.2xSSC containing 0.1% SDS.
As used herein, "highly stringent conditions" or "high
stringency conditions" are those that: (I) employ low ionic
strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015
M sodium chloride/0. 0015 M sodium citrate/0. 1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate at 50' C.; (2) employ during hybridization a
denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v)
formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0. 1% Ficoll/
0.1%polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium
citrate at 42' C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5xSSC (0.75
M NaCI, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5xDenhardt's solu-
tion, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 pg/ml), 0.1% SDS,
and 10% dextran sulfate at 42' C., with washes at 42' C. in
0.2xSSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% forma-
mide at 55' C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting
of O. 1xSSC containing EDTA at 55' C. The skilled artisan
will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength,
etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length
and the like.
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art
that, as a result of the degeneracy ofthe genetic code, there are
many nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide as
described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear mini-
mal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene.
Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in
codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present
invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the poly-
nucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of
the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are
altered as a result ofone or more mutations, such as deletions,
additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting
mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered struc-
ture or function. Alleles may be identified using standard
techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or data-
base sequence comparison).
The polynucleotides of this invention can be obtained
using chemical synthesis, recombinant methods, or PCR.
Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis are well
known in the art and need not be described in detail herein.
One of skill in the art can use the sequences provided herein
and a commercial DNA synthesizer to produce a desired
DNA sequence.
For preparing polynucleotides using recombinant meth-
ods, a polynucleotide comprising a desired sequence can be
inserted into a suitable vector, and the vector in turn can be
introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and ampli-
fication, as further discussed herein. Polynucleotides may be
inserted into host cells by any means known in the art. Cells
are trans formed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide
by direct uptake, endocytosis, transfection, F-mating or elec-
troporation. Once introduced, the exogenous polynucleotide
can be maintained within the cell as a non-integrated vector
(such as a plasmid) or integrated into the host cell genome.
The polynucleotide so amplified can be isolated from the host
cell by methods well known within the art. See, e.g. , Sam-
brook et al. , 1989, supra.
Alternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA
sequences. PCR technology is well known in the art and is
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,800, 159, 4,754,065
41
US 9,175,093 B2
42
and 4,683,202, as well as PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reac-
tion, Mullis et al. , 1994, eds. (Birkauswer Press, Boston,
MA. ).
RNA can be obtained by using the isolated DNA in an
appropriate vector and inserting it into a suitable host cell.
When the cell replicates and the DNA is transcribed into
RNA, the RNA can then be isolated using methods well
known to those of skill in the art, as set forth in Sambrook et
al. , 1989, supra, for example.
Suitable cloning vectors may be constructed according to
standard techniques, or may be selected from a large number
of cloning vectors available in the art. While the cloning
vector selected may vary according to the host cell intended to
be used, useful cloning vectors will generally have the ability
to self-replicate, may possess a single target for a particular
restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry genes for a marker
that can be used in selecting clones containing the vector.
Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial viruses,
e.g. , pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript (e.g. , pBS SK+) and its
derivatives, mp 18, mp 19, pBR322, pMB9, ColEI, pCRI,
RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and
pAT28. These and many other cloning vectors are available
from commercial vendors such as BioRad, Strategene, and
Invitrogen.
Expression vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide
constructs that contain a polynucleotide according to the
invention. It is implied that an expression vector must be
replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an integral
part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression vectors
include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, includ-
ing adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses,
co smids, and expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT Pub 1.No.
WO 87/04462. Vector components may generally include,
but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal
sequence; an origin of replication; one or more marker genes;
suitable transcriptional controlling elements (such as promot-
ers, enhancers and terminator). For expression (ke. , transla-
tion), one or more translational controlling elements are also
usually required, such as ribosome binding sites, translation
initiation sites, and stop codons.
The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can
be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appro-
priate means, including electroporation, trans fection employ-
ing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate,
DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bom-
bardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g. , where the vector is
an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of
introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on
features of the host cell.
The invention also provides host cells comprising any of
the polynucleotides described herein. Any host cells capable
of over-expressing heterologous DNAs can be used for the
purpose of isolating the genes encoding the antibody,
polypeptide or protein of interest. Non-limiting examples of
mammalian host cells include but are not limited to COS,
HeLa, NSO, and CHO cells. See also PCT Publ. No. WO
87/04462. Suitable non-mammalian host cells include
prokaryotes (such as E. co/i or B. subti I/is) and yeast (such as
S. cerevisae, S.pombe; or E. /actis). Preferably, the host cells
express the cDNAs at a level of about 5 fold higher, more
preferably, 10 fold higher, even more preferably, 20 fold
higher than that of the corresponding endogenous antibody or
protein of interest, if present, in the host cells. Screening the
host cells for a specific binding to PCSK9 or a PCSK9 domain
is effected by an immunoassay or FACS. A cell overexpress-
ing the antibody or protein of interest can be identified.

D. Kits
The invention also provides kits for use in the instant meth-
ods. Kits of the invention include one or more containers
comprising a PCSK9 antagonist antibody (such as a human-
ized antibody) or peptide described herein and instructions
for use in accordance with any of the methods ofthe invention
described herein. Generally, these instructions comprise a
description of administration of the PCSK9 antagonist anti-
body, peptide, or aptamer for the above described therapeutic
treatments.
In some embodiments, the antibody is a humanized anti-
body. In some embodiments, the antibody is human. In other
embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The
instructions relating to the use of a PCSK9 antagonist anti-
body generally include information as to dosage, dosing
schedule, and route of administration for the intended treat-
ment. The containers may be unit doses, bulk packages (e.g. ,
multi-dose packages) or sub-unit doses. Instructions supplied
in the kits of the invention are typically written instructions on
a label or package insert (e.g. , a paper sheet included in the
kit), but machine-readable instructions (e.g. , instructions car-
ried on a magnetic or optical storage disk) are also acceptable.
The kits of this invention are in suitable packaging. Suit-
able packaging includes, but is not limited to, vials, bottles,
jars, flexible packaging (e.g. , sealed Mylar or plastic bags),
and the like. Also contemplated are packages for use in com-
bination with a specific device, such as an inhaler, nasal
administration device (e.g. , an atomizer) or an infusion device
such as a minipump. A kit may have a sterile access port (for
example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or
a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection
needle). The container may also have a sterile access port (for
example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or
a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection
needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a
PCSK9 antagonist antibody. The container (e.g. , pre-filled
syringe or autoinjector) may further comprise a second phar-
maceutically active agent.
Kits may optionally provide additional components such
as buffers and interpretive information. Normally, the kit
comprises a container and a label or package insert(s) on or
associated with the container.
Mutations and Modifications
To express the PCSK9 antibodies of the present invention,
DNA fragments encoding V~ and Vz regions can first be
obtained using any of the methods described above. Various
modifications, e.g. , mutations, deletions, and/or additions can
also be introduced into the DNA sequences using standard
methods known to those of skill in the art. For example,
mutagenesis can be carried out using standard methods, such
as PCR-mediated mutagenesis, in which the mutated nucle-
otides are incorporated into the PCR primers such that the
PCR product contains the desired mutations or site-directed
mutagenesis.
One type of substitution, for example, that may be made is
to change one or more cysteines in the antibody, which may
be chemically reactive, to another residue, such as, without
limitation, alanine or serine. For example, there can be a
substitution of a non-canonical cysteine. The substitution can
be made in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain
or in the constant domain of an antibody. In some embodi-
ments, the cysteine is canonical.
The antibodies may also be modified, e.g. , in the variable
domains of the heavy and/or light chains, e.g. , to alter a
binding property of the antibody. For example, a mutation
may be made in one or more of the CDR regions to increase
or decrease the K~ of the antibody for PCSK9, to increase or

decrease k + or to alter the binding specificity of the antibody.
Techniques in site-directed mutagenesis are well-known in
the art. See, e.g. , Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. , supra.
A modification or mutation may also be made in a frame-
work region or constant domain to increase the half-life of a
PCSK9 antibody. See, e.g. , PCT Publ. No. WO 00/09560. A
mutation in a framework region or constant domain can also
be made to alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to
provide a site for covalent or non-covalent binding to another
molecule, or to alter such properties as complement fixation,
FcR binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotox-
icity. According to the invention, a single antibody may have
mutations in any one or more of the CDRs or framework
regions of the variable domain or in the constant domain.
In a process known as "germlining", certain amino acids in
the V~ and Vz sequences can be mutated to match those found
naturally in germline V~ and Vz sequences. In particular, the
amino acid sequences of the framework regions in the V~ and
Vz sequences can be mutated to match the germline
sequences to reduce the risk of immunogenicity when the
antibody is administered. Germline DNA sequences for
human V~ and Vz genes are known in the art (see e.g. , the
"Vbase" human germline sequence database; see also Kabat,
E.A. , et al. (1991)Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S.Department ofHealth and Human
Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242; Tomlinson et al. , 1992, J.
Mol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox et al. , 1994, Eur. J. Immu-
nol. 24:827-836.
Another type of amino acid substitution that may be made
is to remove potential proteolytic sites in the antibody. Such
sites may occur in a CDR or framework region of a variable
domain or in the constant domain ofan antibody. Substitution
of cysteine residues and removal of proteolytic sites may
decrease the risk of heterogeneity in the antibody product and
thus increase its homogeneity. Another type of amino acid
substitution eliminates asparagine-glycine pairs, which form
potential deamidation sites, by altering one or both of the
residues. In another example, the C-terminal lysine of the
heavy chain of a PCSK9 antibody of the invention can be
cleaved. In various embodiments of the invention, the heavy
and light chains of the PCSK9 antibodies may optionally
include a signal sequence.
Once DNA fragments encoding the V~ and Vz segments of
the present invention are obtained, these DNA fragments can
be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA tech-
niques, for example to convert the variable region genes to
full-length antibody chain genes, to Fab fragment genes, or to
a scFv gene. In these manipulations, a Vz- or V~encoding
DNA fragment is operatively linked to another DNA frag-
ment encoding another protein, such as an antibody constant
region or a flexible linker. The term "operatively linked", as
used in this context, is intended to mean that the two DNA
fragments are joined such that the amino acid sequences
encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in-frame.
The isolated DNA encoding the V~ region can be converted
to a full-length heavy chain gene by operatively linking the
V~encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding
heavy chain constant regions (CHI, CH2 and CH3). The
sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are
known in the art (see e.g. , Kabat, E.A. , et al. , 1991,Sequences
of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publ. No.
91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions
can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy
chain constant region can be an IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA,
IgE, IgM or IgD constant region, but most preferably is an
IgGI or IgG2 constant region. The IgG constant region
45
US 9,175,093 B2
46
sequence can be any of the various alleles or allotypes known
to occur among different individuals, such as Gm(1), Gm(2),
Gm(3), and Gm(17). These allotypes represent naturally
occurring amino acid substitution in the IgGI constant
regions. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the V~encod-
ing DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule
encoding only the heavy chain CH I constant region. The CH I
heavy chain constant region may be derived from any of the
heavy chain genes.
The isolated DNA encoding the Vz region can be converted
to a full-length light chain gene (as well as a Fab light chain
gene) by operatively linking the Vz-encoding DNA to another
DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region, Cz.
The sequences ofhuman light chain constant region genes are
known in the art (see e.g. , Kabat, E.A. , et al. , 1991,Sequences
of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publ. No.
91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions
can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The light
chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant
region. The kappa constant region may be any of the various
alleles known to occur among different individuals, such as
Inv(1), Inv(2), and Inv(3). The lambda constant region may be
derived from any of the three lambda genes.
To create a scFv gene, the V~ and Vz-encoding DNA
fragments are operatively linked to another fragment encod-
ing a flexible linker, e.g. , encoding the amino acid sequence
(Gly4-Ser)s, such that the V~ and Vz sequences can be
expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the Vz
and V~ regions joined by the flexible linker (See e.g. , Bird et
al. , 1988, Science 242:423-426; Huston et al. , 1988, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci.USA 85:5879-5883;McCafferty et al. , 1990,
Nature 348:552-554. The single chain antibody may be
monovalent, if only a single V~ and Vz are used, bivalent, if
two V~ and Vz are used, or polyvalent, if more than two V~
and Vz are used. Bispecific or polyvalent antibodies may be
generated that bind specifically to PCSK9 and to another
molecule.
In another embodiment, a fusion antibody or immunoad-
hesin may be made that comprises all or a portion ofa PCSK9
antibody of the invention linked to another polypeptide. In
another embodiment, only the variable domains of the
PCSK9 antibody are linked to the polypeptide. In another
embodiment, the V~ domain ofa PCSK9 antibody is linked to
a first polypeptide, while the Vz domain ofa PCSK9 antibody
is linked to a second polypeptide that associates with the first
polypeptide in a manner such that the V~ and Vz domains can
interact with one another to form an antigen binding site. In
another preferred embodiment, the V~ domain is separated
from the Vz domain by a linker such that the V~ and Vz
domains can interact with one another. The V~linker-Vz
antibody is then linked to the polypeptide of interest. In
addition, fusion antibodies can be created in which two (or
more) single-chain antibodies are linked to one another. This
is useful if one wants to create a divalent or polyvalent anti-
body on a single polypeptide chain, or if one wants to create
a bispecific antibody.
In other embodiments, other modified antibodies may be
prepared using PCSK9 antibody encoding nucleic acid mol-
ecules. For instance, "Kappa bodies" (Ill et al. , 1997, Protein
Eng. 10:949-57),"Minibodies" (Martinet al. , 1994,EMBO J.
13:5303-9),"Diabodies" (Holliger et al. , 1993, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci.USA 90:6444-6448), or "Janusins" (Traunecker et
al. , 1991, EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 and Traunecker et al. ,
1992, Int. J. Cancer (Suppl. ) 7:51-52)may be prepared using
standard molecular biological techniques following the
teachings of the specification.

Generating and Screening PCSK9 Antagonist
Antibodies
General Procedures for Immunization ofAnimals for Gener-
ating Monoclonal Antibodies:
Balb/c or 129/b16 pcsk9 —/ —mice were injected 5 times on
a 13 day schedule with 100 pg antigen. PCSK9—/ —(that is,
null or knock-out mice) can be obtained from, or as described
by, Rashid et al. , 2005, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 5374.
See also U.S. Pat. No. 7,300,754. For the first 4 injections,
antigen was prepared by mixing the recombinant proteins
with adjuvant. Immunogen was given via injection to the
scruff of the neck, the foot pads and intraperitoneally,
approximately every 3 days over the course of 11 days, with
the last boost administered i.v. , without adjuvant. On Day 13,
the mice were euthanized and their spleens were removed.
Bispecific antibodies or antigen-binding fragments can be
produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybri-
domas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g. , Songsivilai &
Lachmann, 1990,Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321,Kostelny
et al. , 1992, J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553.In addition, bispe-
cific antibodies may be formed as "diabodies" or "Janusins. "
In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody binds to two
different epitopes of PCSK9. In some embodiments, the
modified antibodies described above are prepared using one
or more of the variable domains or CDR regions from a
human PCSK9 antibody provided herein.
Generation ofAntigen-Specific Antibodies
More than 500 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
raised against recombinant full-length human PCSK9,
recombinant full length mouse PCSK9, and various synthetic
peptides were evaluated for their ability to down regulate total
LDLR protein in cultured Huh7 human liver cells. Among
these antibodies were a set ofantibodies raised to and reactive
with a set of 12-20 amino acid residue polypeptides that,
based on the structure of PCSK9, were predicted to cover
majority of the protein surface. At the highest concentration,
the best antibodies exhibited only about 60% blocking activ-
ity.
Thus, an alternative and heretofore unexplored approach
was employed, namely, the generation of monoclonal anti-
bodies by immunizing PCSK9 null mice with recombinant
full-length PCSK9 protein. This manner of antibody prepa-
ration yielded antagonist antibodies that show complete
blocking of PCSK9 binding to LDLR, complete blocking of
PCS K9-mediated lowering ofLDLR levels in Huh7 cells, and
lowering of LDLc in vivo including in mice to levels compa-
rable to that seen in PCSK9—/ —mice, as shown in Example 7.
Representative antibodies (hybridomas) of the present
invention were deposited in the American Type Culture Col-
lection (ATCC) on Feb. 28, 2008, and were assigned the
accession numbers in Table 3. Hybridomas were deposited
for antibodies 4A5, 5AI0, 6F6 and 7D4.

Lymphocytes were immortalized by fusion with an estab-
lished cell line to make hybridoma clones using standard
hybridoma technology, distributed into 96 well plates. Clones
were allowed to grow, then selected by ELISA screening
using the immunizing antigen, as below.
ELISA Screening ofAntibodies:
Supernatant media from growing hybridoma clones were
screened separately for their ability to bind the recombinant
human PCSK9 or recombinant mouse PCSK9. The assays
were performed with 96-well plates coated overnight with
100 pl of a I pg/ml solution of one of the antigens. Excess
reagents were washed from the wells between each step with
PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Plates were then blocked
with PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Supernatant was added to
the plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.
Horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat-anti mouse
Fc was added to bind to the mouse antibodies bound to the
antigen. Tetramethyl benzidine was then added as substrate
for HRP to detect the amount of mouse antibody present in the
supernatant. The reaction was stopped and the relative
amount of antibody was quantified by reading the absorbance
at 450 nm. Hybridoma clones that secreted antibodies that are
capable of binding to either mouse or human PCSK9 were
selected for further analysis.
PCSK9-Mediated LDLR Down-Regulation in Huh7 Cells:
Hybridoma clones secreting human or mouse PCSK9
binding antibodies were expanded and supernatants were
harvested. Total IgGs were purified from approximately 10
ml of the supernatant using protein A beads, dialyzed into
PBS buffer, and the final volume reduced to yield solutions
with 0.7-1 mg/ml ofantibodies. Purified antibodies were then
used to test their ability to inhibit the ability of PCSK9 to
mediate LDLR down-regulation in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cells
were plated and allowed to grow to 80% confluency in RPMI
media containing 10% FBS, 4 mM glutamine, and penicillin
and streptavidin in 96 well plates. The medium was changed
to one containing 10%de-lipidated FBSfor 8-16hrs to induce
LDLR expression. Cells were then incubated for 8-16 hours
with 40 pl/well of293 expression media supplemented with 6
pg/ml of human (preferably) or mouse PCSK9, with or with-
out 70-100 pg/ml oftest antibodies. The PCSK9 and antibody
containing media were removed at the end of incubation, and
cells were lysed with 17 pl lysis buffer by shaking at 4 C for
an hour. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM glycerol phos-
phate, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM
NaCI, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). Cell
lysates were collected and analyzed for LDLR protein levels
via staining of Western blots following SDS polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. Hybridoma clones producing antibodies
that can partially or fully rescue LDLR level were selected for
further analysis. By "LDLR down regulation assay" is meant
the above assay using Huh7 cells.
FIG. 1 illustrates the effect of anti-PCSK9 antagonistic
monoclonal antibodies 7D4.4, 4AS.G3, 6F6.G103 and
5AIO B8 on the ability ofhuman and mouse PCSK9 to down
regulate LDLR in cultured Huh7 cells. 100 nM of mouse or
human recombinant PCSK9, and a serial dilution of 25-800
nM of antibodies were used. A) mouse PCSK9. B) human
PCSK9. The figures are Western blots showing that the anti-
bodies are in general more effective in blocking the function
ofhuman PCSk9 than mouse PCSK9. The several antibodies
have generally similar affinities for human PCSK9 but vary in
their affinity for murine PCSK9.

Analysis of the Effect of PCSK9 Antibodies on
PCSK9-LDLR Interaction
PCSK9 has been shown to bind LDLR with an affinity of
180 nM under neutral pH (Cunningham et al. , 2007, Nat
Struct Mol Biol, 14(5):413-9).Recombinantmouse orhuman
PCSK9 protein was biotinylated using the Pierce reagents
following the manufacture's instructions. ELISA plates
(Corning Mixisorb) were coated with a solution of I pg/ml
recombinant LDLR extracellular domain (R&D Systems) in
each well at 4 C overnight, blocked with 2% BSA+PBS for 2
hrs at room temperature, and then washed 5 times with wash-
ing buffer (IxPBS+0.05% Tween-20). Wells were incubated
with 50 pl of indicated concentrations of biotinylated PCSK9
protein for I hr RT. LDLR-PCSK9 binding can be stabilized
by adding 50 pl of 4% FDH+4% sucrose+PBS solution and
incubate for 5 min. Wells were washed 5 times with washing
buffer, incubated with I:2000 dilution of HRP conjugated
Strepavidin (Invitrogen) for I hr at RT, washed 5 times with
washing buffer. TMB substrate was added to the wells, the
solution was incubated 20 to 30 min at RT, and the reaction
was terminated using I M phosphoric acid. Signals were read
at 450 nm.
FIG. 2 illustrates the dose-response ofanti-PCSK9 antago-
nist monoclonal antibodies 6F6.G103, 7D4.4, 4AS.G3,
5A I0.B8,negative control antibody 42H7, and PBS on block-
ing the binding of recombinant biotinylated human PCSK9
and mouse PCSK9 to immobilized recombinant LDLR extra-
cellular domain in vitro. Part A) shows human PCSK9 bind-
sor equipped with a research-grade sensor chip using HBS-
EP running buffer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden now GE
Healthcare). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ms IgGs were amine-
coupled at saturating levels onto the chip using a standard
N-hydroxysuccinimide/ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodi-
imide (NHS/EDC) chemistry. The buffer was switched to
HBS-EP+I mg/mL BSA+I mg/mL CM-dextran. Full-length
PCSK9 IgGs were diluted to about 15 pg/mL and captured for
I min at 5 pL/min to give levels ofabout 500RU per flow cell,
leaving one blank to serve as a reference channel. 3.73-302
nM hPCSK9 or 2.54-206 nM mPCSK9 were injected as a
5-membered 3-fold series for I min at 100 pL/min. Dissocia-
tion was monitored for 5 min. The chip was regenerated after
the last injection of each titration with two 30 sec pulses of
100 mM phosphoric acid. Buffer cycles provided blanks for
double-referencing the data, which were then fit globally to a
simple binding model using Biaevaluation software v.4.1.
Affinities were deduced from the quotient of the kinetic rate
constants (K~=k gk ).The results of Example 2 are shown
in Table 4. These data show that the antibodies have excellent
affinity for murine PCSK9 or human PCSK9, as indicated.

ing to human LDLR extracellular domain and that 7D4, 4A5,
5AIO, and 6F6 are effective in blocking binding, whereas
42H7 and PBS are not. Part B) shows mouse PCSK9 binding
to human LDLR extracellular domain.
The interaction can also be evaluated in free solution at
neutral pH. FIG. 3 illustrates the dose-response of anti-
PCSK9 monoclonal antagonist antibodies 6F6.G103, 7D4.4,
4AS.G3 and 5AIO.B8 on blocking binding of recombinant
biotinylated human PCSK9 (30 nM) to Europium labeled
recombinant LDLR extracellular domain (10nM) in solution
at neutral pH in vitro. This assay measures binding in free
solution at neutral pH.
Example 4
Epitope Mapping/Binding ofAntibodies Using the
Crystal Structure of the LIL3:PCSK9 Complex,
Biacore, and Mutagenesis
a. Crystal structure of the LI L3:PCSK9 complex. The resi-
dues were identified by calculating the difference in acces-
sible surface area between the LIL3:PCSK9 crystal structure
and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that show buried
surface area upon complex formation with LIL3 antibody
were included as a part of the epitope. The solvent accessible
surface of a protein was defined as the locus of the centre of a
probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 1.4 A.
radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface ofthe protein.
The solvent accessible surface area was calculated by gener-
ating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom
(at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the
atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within
equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms as
implemented in program AREAIMOL (Briggs, P. J., 2000,
CCP4 Newsletter No. 38, CCLRC, Daresbury).
The result of the crystal structure analysis is shown in FIG.
23. FIG. 23A shows the crystal structure of the PCSK9 (light
gray surface representation) bound to the LIL3 antibody
(black cartoon representation). The epitope for L IL3 binding
to PCSK9 involves residues 153-155,194, 197,237-239, 367,
369, 374-379 and 381 of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence
(SEQ ID NO:188). By comparison, the epitope for the LDLR
EGF domain binding to PCSK9 involves residues 153-155,
194, 238, 367, 369, 372, 374-375, and 377-381 (Kwon et al. ,
2008, PNAS 105: 1820-1825).
b. Group antibodies and epitopes based on competition in
PCSK9 binding. Full-length IgGs were amine-coupled to a
CM5 sensor chip (three per chip at about 7000RU final), using
a standard EDC/NHS-mediated amine-coupling chemistry.
One flow cell was left unmodified to provide a reference
channel. Human-PCSK9 (100 nM) was premixed with an
array of IgGs (final 500 nM) and these complexes were
injected over the chip using I min injections at 10 iIL/min.
Antibodies that bind to competing epitopes will block the
binding of PCSK9 to the antibody immobilized on the chip.
Alternatively, a classical sandwich approach was used by first
injecting human-PCSK9 at 50 nM for I min at 10 iIL/min (to
tether it via the IgG on the chip) and then binding an array of
IgGs (final 500 nM each) for 2 mins each. The immobilized
IgGs were regenerated with a mild acid (Pierce gentle elution
buffer+I M NaCI). Antibodies directed to known different
epitopes were used as controls for positive sandwich forma-
tion in this assay.
c. Structure-guided mutagenesis to map antibody binding
epitopes. Based on the crystal structure of PCSK9 and the
likely involvement of D374 in LDLR binding (Cunningham
et al. , 2007, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 14(5): 413-419), nineteen

f. Biacore binding of the mutants to immobilized LDLR.
Recombinant LDLR extracelluar domain protein was immo-
bilized onto a Biacore SA chip. Each mutant protein was
injected to the Biacore-3000 M) in duplicates at 25 mM to
0.012 mM at five concentrations (from I' C., with a running
buffer of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM CaC12, 200 mM NaCI,
0.02% P20 and I mg/ml BSA.All the results
fit
nicel to a I:I
binding kinetics model. As expected, mutation at residues in
direct contact with the EGF-A domain (F379A, R194A,
1369A, T377R, D238R) significantly weakens (by 10-100
fold) LDLR binding. Moreover, three mutants not in contact
with EGF-A (R199A, R218A, K222A) showed weaker bind-
ing (5-15 fold). This new finding suggests that they are
involved in binding other domains of LDLR. Overall, these
experiments validate the integrity and activity of the mutants
for subsequent epitope mapping experiments.
g. Binding of the mutants to immobilized 4A5, 7D4, 5AI 0
and 6F6 antibodies. Biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibodies
were immobilized on SA chips using standard methods.
Mutant binding experiments were performed using Biacore
3000 at 25' C. with a running buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCI pH
PCSK9 surface-residue mutants (F379A, 1369A, R194A,
D374Y, D238R, T377R, K222A, R199A, F216A, R218A,
R237A, D192R, D367R, R165A, R167A, A443T, A53V,
1474V, H449A) near or far from the position of D374 were
chosen for mutation to map the antibody binding epitopes.
d. Mutant and antibody production. The 19 single point
mutants were generated from the previously described wild-
type DNA construct (Cunningham et al. , 2007, supra) using
standard DNA techniques. The mutant proteins were
expressed using transient transfection in HEK293T cells and
secreted into the cell media. The mutant proteins were puri-
fied with the high-throughput AKTA Xpress system (GE
Healthcare) by Ni and size-exclusion chromatography
steps, using conditions similar to those described earlier. Pro-
tein concentrations were determined using the LabChip
instrument (Bio-Rad). The PCSK9-blocking murine antibod-
ies 4A5, 7D4, 5AIO and 6F6 were expressed with transient
trans fection in HEK293F cells and purified with a protein G
column eluted with 0.1 M Glycine buffer at pH 2.8 and
neutralized into 1.0 M Tris at pH 9.0.
e. The regions ofPCSK9 that are contacted by monoclonal
antibodies 5AI 0 and 7D4 (preparation described later herein)
were determined by protein tomography (Sidec AB, Stock-
holm, Sweden). The loops at positions 186-200, 371-379,
176-181,278-283, 449-453, 402-406, and 236-245 ofPCSK9
were proximal to amino acid residues of the antibody. The
sequences corresponding to the loops are shown in Table 5,
and in a preferred embodiment, the antagonists of the inven-
tion bind to one or more of these sequences in PSCK9.

Cloning and Sequencing ofAntibodies
One million hybridoma cells were homogenized using the
QIAshredder spin columns and total RNA was extracted
according to RNAeasy Micro kit from QIAGEN. cDNA was
synthesized using SuperScript III RT kit from Invitrogen.
Variable regions from the PCSK9 antibodies were cloned
using the mouse IgG-Primer Sets from Novagen, which con-
sist of degenerate primers for cloning mouse IgG heavy chain
genes and the mouse kappa or lambda light chains. PCR
cycling conditions were the followings: I cycle at 92 C for 2
min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 44 C for 30 sec and 72 C
for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 46 C for 30 sec and
72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 48 C for 30 sec
and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 50 C for 30
sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 52 C for
30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles at 94 C for
30 sec, 54 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 45 sec. The resulting PCR
products were cloned into Topo- TA cloning vector from Invit-
rogen and sequenced. The cloned antibody sequences were
confirmed by ¹erminal sequencing of the first 10 amino
acids of the original antibodies produced from ascites.

Generation ofAntigens for Immunization
Recombinant human PCSK9 protein was produced as
reported Cunningham et al. , 2007, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 14(5):
413-9. To produce recombinant mouse PCSK9 protein, the
cDNA ofmouse PCSK9 was cloned into mammalian expres-
sion vector PRK5 with the addition of a 6-His tag at the
C-terminus by methods known in the art, transiently trans-
fected and expressed in HEK293 cells. Recombinant protein
was purified from conditioned media using a Ni column.
Surface peptides of human and mouse PCSK9 were
selected based on PCSK9 protein structure, and synthesized
by Elim Biopharmaceuticals.

a. Identification of PCSK9-Blocking Antibodies
Murine antibodies to human and/or mouse PCSK9 were
generated by immunizing mice with human-PCSK9 and
mouse-PCSK9 synthetic peptides as prepared in Example 6
or recombinant proteins, and screening antibodies by ELISA
assay using human and/or mouse PCSK9 recombinant pro-
tein as the antigens as described in Example I and other
standard hybridoma procedures. Over 500 positive clones
were obtained and allowed to grow to confluency in 6 well
plates with 10 ml media. Media supernatant were collected

d. Determining Sequences Species Specificity of Anti-
PCSK9 Antibodies
To determine the species specificity of the anti-PCSK9
antibodies, antibodies were incubated with plasma from dif-
ferent species and the resultant complexes were purified and
probed by an independent anti PCSK9 antibody on Western
and total IgGs in the conditioned media were purified using
mAb Select (Pierce). The ability ofpurified and concentrated
mouse IgGs to inhibit mouse and human PCS K9 function was
tested in Huh7 cells using the methods described in Example
1. Hybridoma clones expressing IgGs that showed some
degrees of blocking were expanded and retested. 60 promis-
ing clones were subcloned, expanded, and injected into either
Balb/c or nude mice to produce ascites. Antibodies purified
from ascites fluid were retested for their ability to inhibit the
down regulation of LDLR by human or mouse PCSK9 in
Huh7 cells. Four hybridoma clones, 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and
7D4, were identified as being able to completely inhibit
human PCSK9 function, and at least partially inhibit mouse
PCS K9 function. To determine ICs 0 ofeach ofthese blocking
antibodies, a serial dilution of IgGs were used in the assay,
starting from 100 pg/ml to 3.125 pg/ml, with human and
mouse PCSK9 concentration being constant at 6 pg/ml.
b. Effect of PCSK9 Antagonists on PCSK9-LDLR Binding
PCSK9 has been shown to be co-localized with LDLR in
cellular compartments (Lagace et al. , 2006, J Clin Inv, 116
(11):2995-3005.Recombinant PCSK9 protein also binds to
LDLR extracellular domain in vitro (Fisher et al. , 2007, JBC,
282(28):20502-12. To determine the relationship between
inhibition of PCS K9 mediated down-regulation ofLDLR and
inhibition of PCSK9-LDLR binding by antibodies, we tested
the PCSK9 antibodies that partially or completely blocked
PCSK9 function on LDLR and representatives of antibodies
that do not block. All partial antagonistic antibodies also
partially inhibited LDLR extracellular domain binding to
PCSK9, except one. Antagonistic antibodies that can com-
pletely block PCSK9 function, namely 4A5, 5AI0, 6F6 and
7D4 also completely inhibited LDLR extracellular domain
binding to PCSK9 (Table 5). ICso values of these four anti-
bodies correlates with their binding affinity to PCSK9.
c. Epitope Determination of the Blocking Antibodies
FIG. 4 illustrates the epitope binning of anti-PCSK9 anti-
bodies. Part A) shows epitope information of anti-PCSK9
mAbs, determined by binding to synthetic 13-18-mer pep-
tides or epitope binding via Biacore. Part B) shows the ability
of immobilized antibodies 6F6, 5AIO and 4A5 to bind to
human PCSK9 premixed with the mAbs indicated on the y
axis by Biacore assay.
Another monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibody, termed 6G7,
binds to recombinant mouse PCSK9 but not human PCSK9.
See Table 6. 6G7, 4A5, 5AI 0, 6F6, and 7D4 mutually exclude
each other's binding to mouse PCSK9. Chimera analysis
between mouse and human PCSK9 reveals that 6G7 binding
to PCSK9 requires the catalytic domain. See Table 6.Thus the
binding sites of 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 7D4 overlap the cata-
lytic site and/or the epitope bound by 6G7.

blots. The antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 7D4 recognized
human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and rat PCSK9. See
FIG. 5.Antibody 6G7 recognized only murine PCSK9 and an
unrelated control antibody 42H7 did not recognize any tested
PCSK9. Id.
e. Determining Sequences ofAntagonist PCSK9 Antibodies
The amino acid sequences of the variable domains of
PCSK9 antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 7D4 were deter-
mined using the method described in Example 5. The
sequences indicate that the antibodies are related but different
from each other. Table I shows the amino acid sequences of
the variable regions ofeach antibody. Table 7 shows the CDR
sequences of the light chains and heavy chains of Table I as
identified by the Kabat and Chotia methods.
into male 7 week old C57/b16 mice via i.p. injections on days
0, I, 2, and 3. Mice were sacrificed on day 4 without fasting,
and serum samples were collected. All frozen serum samples
were sent to IDEXX laboratories for total cholesterol, trig-
5 lyceride, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol measure-
ments. FIG. 6 shows that 7D4 lowered serum cholesterol by
48%, while the control antibody did not have any significant
affect. Both the amount and percentage ofreduction are simi-
lar to what was reported for PCSK9—/ —mice (PCSK9 knock-
lo out mice), suggesting that one can achieve complete or near
complete inhibition of PCSK9 function through blocking
extracellular PCSK9 only, and that intracellular PCSK9 plays
little or no role in down-regulating LDLR under normal
physiological conditions. As expected, liver LDLR levels

2. Effect ofPCSK9 Specific Antibodies as PCSK9 Antagonist
In Vivo
a. PCS K9 Antagonist Antibodies Lower Serum Cholesterol in
Mice
To determine if PCSK9 antagonist monoclonal antibodies
can affect cholesterol levels in vivo by inhibiting the function
of extracellular PCSK9, the effect of 7D4 was tested against
mouse PCSK9 in vitro, on serum cholesterol when injected
into mice. 6 to 7 week old male 057/b16 mice were kept on a
12 hr light/dark cycle, bled to collect approximately 70 )Il
serum on day —7. Antagonist PCSK9 antibody 7D4, and a
control isotype matching monoclonal antibody were injected
55
were induced in animals treated with 7D4 compared to those
treated with a control antibody (FIG. 6).
b. A Partially Blocking Antibody Had No Effect on Blood
Cholesterol Levels
60 FIG. 7 illustrates that a partial antagonist polyclonal anti-
PCSK9 mAb CRN6 does not affect cholesterol levels in mice.
Two groups of 8 week old C57/b16 mice (n=10 mice/group)
were bled and tested for cholesterol levels on day -7; dosed
with 15 mg/kg/day of CRN6 or a control antibody by i.v.
65 administration on days 0, I, 2 and 3; and then bled and tested
for cholesterol levels 24 hrs after the final dose. FIG. 7A
shows that CRN6 antibody partially blocks PCSK9 mediated
55
US 9,175,093 B2

down regulation of LDLR in Huh7 cells in vitro. FIG. 7B
shows that administration of CRN6 antibody does not affect
serum cholesterol levels in mice.
c. Prolonged Effect on Serum Cholesterol by Antagonist
PCSK9 mAb in Mice.
A time course study was performed to determine the time
of onset and duration of the cholesterol lowering effect of
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies in mice. MAb 7D4 or saline
control were each injected i.v. at 10 mg/kg or 3 ml/kg in 48
6-week-old C57/b16 mice. Eight mice from each treatment
group were sacrificed on days I, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 21 after
injection. A single injection of 7D4 produced a fast and pro-
longed lowering effect on serum cholesterol. A 25% reduc-
tion in serum cholesterol was seen at 24 hrs after injection.
See FIG. S. Maximum drop of serum cholesterol was
observed at the 7 day time point. At 21 days, the reduction in
cholesterol is no longer statistically significant. Part B) shows
HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol levels were very low.
FIG. 9 illustrates that the anti-PCSK9 antagonist mAb 7D4
dose dependently reduces serum total cholesterol, HDL, and
LDL in mice. Six groups of 8 week old 057/b16 mice (n=8/
group) were bled and tested for basal cholesterol levels on day
-7 and administered with the indicated doses of antibodies or
saline on days 0, I, 2, and 3 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum
samples were collected and tested for cholesterol levels 24 hrs
after the last dose. FIG. 9A shows total cholesterol levels,
which decreased to less than 60% of control after administra-
tion of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. The maximal effect on total cho-
lesterol was seen at 10 mg/kg, and statistically significant
reduction at I mg/kg. FIG. 9B shows HDL levels, which
decreased to less than 70% after administration of 3 to 30
mg/kg/day. FIG. 9C shows LDL levels, which decreased to
nearly zero at all tested doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day and above.
d. Dose Response of Antagonist Antibodies Specific to
PCSK9 in Mice
FIG. 10 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibody
5AIO dose dependently lowers cholesterol levels in mice.
FIG. 10A shows six groups of 8 week old 057/b16 mice
(n=8/group) to which were administered the indicated doses
ofantibodies or saline daily on days 0, I, 2, and 3 by i.v. bolus
injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cho-
lesterol levels 24 hrs after the last dose and showed a gradu-
ated decrease with increasing dose of antibody. FIG. 10B
shows five groups of8 week old C57/b16 mice (n=8/group) to
which were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or
saline on day 0 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum samples were
collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7 and also
showed .a graduated decrease with increasing doses of anti-
body.
FIG. 11 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibodies
4A5 and 6F6 lower cholesterol levels in mice in a dose-
dependent fashion. Eight week old C57/b16 mice (n=8/
group) were administered the indicated doses ofantibodies or
saline on day 0 by i.p. bolus injection. Serum samples were
collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7. In FIG.
11A, the antibody 4A5 showed a graduated decrease in total
serum cholesterol with increasing dose of antibody. In FIG.
11B,the antibody 6F6 showed decrease in total serum cho-
lesterol at 10 mg/kg/day.
Anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6 and
7D4 increase liver LDLR levels in mice as found by Western
blot analysis. See FIG. 12. For 4A5, 5AIO and 6F6, 8 week
old C57/b16 mice were administered with 10 mg/kg of anti-
bodies or saline on day 0 by i.v. bolus injection, animals were
sacrificed on day 7, and whole liver lysate of 3 individual
animals were analyzed for LDLR and GAPDH protein levels
by Western. For 7D4, 8 week old B16/c57 mice were admin-

istered with 10 mg/kg of antibodies on days 0, I, 2, and 3 via
i. p. bolus injection, animals were sacrificed on day 4, and
whole liver lysate of 3 individual animals were analyzed for
LDLR and GAPDH protein levels by Western blot. All anti-
body-treated mice showed high levels of LDLR as compared
to the PBS control mice.
FIG. 13 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist antibody
has no effect in the LDLR—/ — mouse. Eight week old
LDLR—/ —mice (LDLR KO mice) were administered 10
mg/kg 4A5 or saline on day 0 by i.p. bolus injection. Serum
samples (from n=9-10 mice) were collected and tested for
cholesterol levels on day 7. Administration of the antibody
did not appreciably alter the levels of total serum cholesterol,
HDL, or LDL.
FIG. 14 illustrates that multiple treatments of anti-PCSK9
antagonist antibodies in mice can substantially decrease total
serum cholesterol. Eight week old C57/b16 mice were admin-
istered the indicated doses of antibodies or PBS on days 0, 7,
14 and 21 by i.v. bolus injection. Serum samples (n=5-11
mice) were collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day
28.
Example 8
PCSK9 Antagonist Antibodies Lower Serum LDL in
Non-Human Primates
To test the in vivo effect of antibodies to PCSK9, antibody
7D4 was tested in cynomolgus monkeys. Four 3-4 year old
cynomolgus monkey were inj ected with vehicle (PBS+0.01%
Tween 20) on day 0, and 10mg/kg 7D4 on day 7. Plasma lipid
profiles were analyzed on days 0, 2, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21 and 28
following overnight fasting. A single injection of 10 mg/kg
7D4 produced a dramatic reduction in plasma LDL (60%)
(FIG. 15A) and LDL particle numbers (FIG. 15D) in all 4
animals, while having minimal effect on their HDL levels
(FIG. 15B) and HDL particle numbers (FIG. 15E). Total
cholesterol (FIG. 15C)was also reduced following 7D4 treat-
ment, while triglyceride level (FIG. 15F) was not signifi-
cantly affected. Total 7D4 (G), and total PCSK9 levels (H)
were also measured.
FIGS. 16A-D illustrate the dose-response of anti-PCSK9
antibody 7D4 on serum cholesterol levels in the cynomolgus
monkey. Two male and two female cynomolgus monkeys 3-5
years of age in each group were given the indicated dose of
7D4 on day 7 and an equal volume of saline on day 0 by i.v.
bolus injection. Plasma samples were taken at indicated time
points and plasma LDL levels were measured.
FIG. 17 illustrates a comparison of anti-PCSK9 antibodies
4A5 (FIG. 17A), 5AI0 (FIG. 17B), 6F6 (FIG. 17C) and 7D4
(FIG. 17D) on serum cholesterol levels in the cynomolgus
monkey. Two male and two female cynomolgus monkeys 3-6
years ofage in each group were given I mg/kg of the indicated
antibody on day 0 by i.v. bolus injection. Plasma samples
were taken at indicated time points, plasma LDL levels were
measured and normalized to that on day -2.
FIG. 1S illustrates the effect of anti-PCSK9 antagonist
antibody 7D4 on plasma cholesterol levels of cynomolgus
monkeys fed a 33.4% kcal fat diet supplemented with 0.1%
cholesterol. Six 3-5 year old cynomolgus monkeys were put
on high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Three monkeys were treated
with 10 mg/kg 7D4 and three with saline on the indicated
date. LDL levels of individual monkeys were measured and
normalized to that of the treatment day.

Example 9
Humanized Anti-PCSK9 Antibody
The murine monoclonal antibody 5AIO was humanized
and affinity matured to provide the LI L3 antibody. LI L3 has
an affinity for murine PCSK9 of 200 pM and an affinity for
human PCSK9 of 100 pM when measured by Biacore. LI L3
completely inhibits the PCSK9-mediated down regulation of
LDLR in cultured Huh7 cells when incubated with 100 nM
human or murine PCSK9 antibody. See FIG. 19.
FIG. 20 illustrates the dose-response of LIL3, mouse pre-
cursor 5AI 0, and negative control antibody 42H7 to block the
binding of recombinant biotinylated human PCSK9 and
mouse PCSK9 to immobilized recombinant LDLR extracel-
lular domain in vitro. FIG. 20A shows human PCSK9 binding
to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 7.5. FIG. 20B
shows human PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular
domain at pH 5.3.FIG. 20C shows mouse PCSK9 binding to
human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 7.5. FIG. 20D
shows mouse PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular
domain at pH 53.
FIG. 21 shows the effect on serum cholesterol of treatment
with 10 mg/kg LIL3 in mice. Two groups (n=8/group) of 8
week old 057/b16 mice were dosed with 10mg/kg L I L3 or an
equal volume of saline by i. p. injection on day 0. Serum
samples were collected and assayed for cholesterol levels on
days 2, 4 and 7. LIL3 decreased total serum cholesterol by
about 40'zo at days 2 and 4. In another study, when 10 mg/kg
ofL IL3 was administered as a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose
to C57BL/6 mice fed a normal diet (n=10), serum cholesterol
levels were reduced by 47'/o compared to saline treated con-
trols, 4 days post treatment. When L I L3 was administered as
a single IP dose at 0, 0.1, I, 10 and 80 mg/kg (n=6/group) in
a dose-response experiment in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed
a normal diet, serum cholesterol levels were dose-depen-
dently reduced, with maximum effect of 50'zo seen at 10 and
80 mg/kg, 48 hours post dosing. The duration of the choles-
terol repression was also dose dependent, ranging from I to
21 days.
The amino acid sequence of LIL3 fully humanized heavy
chain (SEQ ID NO: 15) is shown in Table 8. The sequence of
the variable region is underlined (SEQ ID NO: 54).

FIG. 22 shows the effect of intravenous administration of
an effective dose (3 mg/kg) of antibody 5AI0 (solid circles)
or antibody LI L3 (solid squares) to each of four cynomolgus
monkeys at day zero. The change in serum HDL (FIG. 22A)
and serum LDL (FIG. 22B) was measured from —2 to +28
days. Both antibodies resulted in greater than about 70'zo
decrease in serum LDL levels by about seven days, an effect
that substantially persisted for about six more days in the
animals administered LIL3. All the animals showed normal
liver and kidney function and near-normal hematocrits.
LI L3 dose-dependently reduced LDL-C, with a maximum
effect observed in the 10 mg/kg group, which maintained a
70'zo reduction in LDL-C levels until day 21 post-dosing, and
fully recovered by day 31.HDL-C levels were not affected by
LI L3 treatment in all dose groups. The animals in the 3 mg/kg
dose group (n=4) were also given two additional IV doses of
3 mg/kg LI L3 on study days 42 and 56 (2-weeks apart). These
two additional doses again lowered LDL-C and maintained
LDL-C levels below 50'zo for4 weeks. LDL-Clevelsreturned
to normal two weeks later. Serum HDL-C levels remained
unchanged throughout the study.
The efficacy of LI L3 in non-human primates with hyper-
cholesterolemia and pharmacodynamic interactions between
L I L3 and HMG-CoA reductase inhibiting statins were inves-
tigated. Prior to the initiation ofthe study, the LDL-C levels of
a cohort of cynomolgus monkeys (n=12) were elevated to an
average of 120mg/dL, compared to the normal average levels
of 50 mg/dL, by feeding with a diet containing 35'zo fat
(wt/wt) and 600 ppm cholesterol for over 18months. Surpris-
ingly, no effect was observed on serum total cholesterol or
LDL-C levels after the daily administration ofa medium-dose
(10 mg/animal) of Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) for 6
weeks, and after a subsequent daily administration of high-
dose (20 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. A single administration of 3
mg/kg L I L3 with Crestor or vehicle treatment for 2 weeks,
effectively lowered serum LDL-C levels by 56'zo by day 5
post treatment, and gradually recovered in 2.5 to 3 weeks
while not affecting HDL-C levels. Upon switching the ani-
mals to daily administration of 50 mg/kg Zocor (simvasta-
tin), their LDL-C levels reached a maximal reduction of 43'zo
at day 5, and stabilized thereafter. After 3 weeks of 50 mg/kg/
day Zocor administration, these animals were treated with a
single dose of 3 mg/kg LIL3 while still receiving 50 mg/kg/
day Zocor. Administration of LIL3 resulted in another
additional 65'zo reduction in LDL-C, in addition to the 43'zo
reduction by Zocor, by day 5, and returned to pre-dosing
levels within 2 weeks.
Other CDR amino acid substitutions were made to 5AI 0 in
the course of humanization and affinity maturation and to
achieve particular properties. The sequences of the modified
CDRs and the PCSK9 binding abilities of the antibodies
containing these modified CDRs are listed in FIGS. 24 A-G.
