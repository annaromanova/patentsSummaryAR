ABSTRACT 
The present invention provides antagonizing antibodies, anti- 
gen-binding portions thereof, and aptamers that bind to pro- 
protein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 1PCSK9). Also 
provided are antibodies directed to peptides, in which the 
antibodies bind to PCSK9. The invention further provides a 
method of obtaining such antibodies and antibody-encoding 
nucleic acid. The invention further relates to therapeutic 
methods for use of these antibodies and antigen-binding por- 
tions thereof to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels and/or for the 
treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular disease, 
including treatment of hypercholesterolemia.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
[0003] The present invention relates to antibodies, e. g. , full 
length antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof, pep- 
tides, and aptamers that antagonize the activity of extracellu- 
lar proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), 
including its interaction with the low density lipoprotein 
(LDL) receptor (LDLR). More specifically, the invention 
relates to compositions comprising antagonist PCSK9 anti- 
bodies, peptides, and/or aptamers and methods of using these 
antibodies and/or peptides and/or aptamers as a medicament. 
The antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers 
can be used therapeutically to lower LDL-cholesterol levels 
in blood, and can be used in the prevention and/or treatment of 
cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including 
familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, 
atherosclerosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
[0004] Millions of people in the U. S. are at risk for heart 
disease and resulting cardiac events. CVD and underlying 
atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death among all demo- 
graphic groups, despite the availability of therapies directed 
at its multiple risk factors. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the 
arteries and is responsible for coronary heart disease associ- 
ated with many deaths in industrialized countries. Several risk 
factors for coronary heart disease have now been identified: 
dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet, 
inactivity and stress. The most clinically relevant and com- 
mon dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in beta- 
lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL) 
with hypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of 
hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrlckson et al. , 1967, N Engl I Med. 
276:34-42, 94-103, 148-156, 215-225, and 273-281). There is 
a long-felt significant unmet need with respect to CVD with 
60-70% of cardiovascular events, heart attacks and strokes 
occurring despite the treatment with statins (the current stan- 
dard of care in atherosclerosis). Moreover, new guidelines 
suggest that even lower LDL levels should be achieved in 
order to protect high risk patients from premature CVD [Na- 
tional Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2004]. 
[0005] PCSK9, also known as NARC-1, was identified as a 
protein with a genetic mutation in some forms of familial 
hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen 
that undergoes autocatalytic processing at the motif LVFAQ 
in the endoplasmic reticulum. Population studies have shown 
that some PCSK9 mutations are "gain-of-function" and are 
found in individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholes- 
terolemia, while other "loss-of-function" (LOF) mutations 
are linked with reduced plasma cholesterol. Morbidity and 
mortality studies in this group clearly demonstrated that 
reducing PCSK9 function significantly diminished the risk of 
cardiovascular disease. 
[0006] Of significant importance to the treatment of CVD, 
a LOF mutation may sensitize humans to statins, allowing for 
efficacy at a lower dose (hence, improving risks associated 
with safety and tolerance) and potentially achieving lower 
plasma cholesterol levels than with current therapies. 
[0007] PCSK9 is secreted into the plasma predominantly 
by hepatocytes. Genetic modulation of PCSK9 in mice con- 
firmed the ability of PCSK9 to regulate blood lipids, and 
suggested that it acts to down-regulate hepatic LDLR protein 
levels. 
[0008] The mechanism by which, and the site at which, 
PCSK9 down-regulates LDLR protein has not been clearly 
established. When over-expressed, PCSK9 may act both 
within the hepatocyte and as a secreted ligand for LDLR. 
There is strong evidence that extracellular PCSK9 binds to 
cell surface LDLR and promotes LDLR degradation at an 
intracellular site. However, it is also possible that PCSK9 
could interact with the LDLR when the two proteins are 
translated within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic 
through endosomal compartments towards the cell mem- 
brane. Maxwell et al. , 2005, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 16:167-172, 
showed that PCSK9-mediated LDLR endocytosis and degra- 
dation was not altered by proteosome inhibitors nor was it 
modulated by different classes of lysosomal and nonlysoso- 
mal proteases. Two naturally occurring familial hypercholes- 
terolemia mutations, S127R and D129G, have been reported 
to be defective in autoprocessing and secretion as levels of 
these mutant proteins were greatly reduced or undetectable in 
the media of transfected cells. Yet these mutants demon- 
strated an enhanced ability to down-regulate LDLR, consis- 
tent with their identification in individuals with high plasma 
LDL (Horner et al. , 2008, Atherosclerosis 196:659-666; 
Cameron et al. , 2006 Human Molecular Genetics 15:1551- 
1558; Lambert et al. , 2006, TRENDS in Endocrinology and 
Metabolism 17:79-81. Since these mutants apparently do not 
get secreted extracellularly, and yet do downregulate LDLR, 
this strongly suggests that an intracellular site of action is 
physiologically important. 
[0009] From the information available in the art, and prior 
to the present invention, it remained unclear whether the 
introduction of an antibody-, peptide-, or aptamer-based 
PCSK9 antagonist into the blood circulation to selectively 
antagonize extracellular PCSK9 would be effective to reduce 
hypercholesterolemia and the associated incidence of CVD 
and, if so, what properties of a PCSK9 antagonist are needed 
for such in vivo effectiveness. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
[0010] This invention relates to antagonist antibodies, pep- 
tides, and aptamers that selectively interact with and inhibit 
PCSK9 function. It is demonstrated for the first time that 
certain PCSK9 antagonists are effective in vivo to lower 
blood cholesterol. 
[0011] In one embodiment, the invention provides an iso- 
lated antagonist of PCSK9 which comprises an antibody, a 
peptide, or an aptamer, which interacts with PCSK9 and when 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
administered to a subject lowers the LDL-cholesterol level in 
blood of said subject. The antagonist can be an antibody, for 
example, a monoclonal antibody or human, humanized, or 
chimeric antibody. 
[0012] In another embodiment, the invention provides an 
isolated anti-PCSK9 antibody which specifically binds to 
PCSK9 and which is a full antagonist of the PCSK9-mediated 
effect on LDLR levels when measured in vitro using the 
LDLR down regulation assay in Huh7 cells disclosed herein. 
[0013] In yet another embodiment, the invention provides 
an isolated antibody which antagonizes the extracellular 
interaction of PCSK9 with the LDLR, as measured by PCSK9 
binding to the LDLR in vitro, and, when administered to a 
subject, lowers the LDL-cholesterol level in blood of said 
subject. Preferably, the antibody recognizes an epitope on 
human PCSK9 that overlaps with more than about 75% of the 
surface on PCSK9 that interacts with the EGF-like domain of 
the LDLR as described in Kwon et al. , 2008, PNAS, 105: 
1820-1825. 
[0014] In yet another embodiment, the invention provides 
an antibody that recognizes a first epitope of PCSK9 that 
overlaps with a second epitope that is recognized by a mono- 
clonal antibody selected from the group consisting of 5AIO, 
which is produced by a hybridoma cellline deposited with the 
American Type Culture Collection and assigned accession 
number PTA-8986; 4A5, which is produced by a hybridoma 
cell line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection 
and assigned accession number PTA-8985; 6F6, which is 
produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited with the Ameri- 
can Type Culture Collection and assigned accession number 
PTA-8984, and 7D4, which is produced by a hybridoma cell 
line deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and 
assigned accession number PTA-8983. 
[0015] In another embodiment, the invention provides an 
antibody to human PCSK9, wherein the antibody recognizes 
an epitope on human PCSK9 comprising amino acid residues 
153-155, 194, 195, 197, 237-239, 367, 369, 374-379 and 381 
of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 53. 
Preferably, the antibody epitope on human PCSK9 does not 
comprise one or more of amino acid residues 71, 72, 150-152, 
187-192, 198-202, 212, 214-217, 220-226, 243, 255-258, 
317, 318, 347-351, 372, 373, 380, 382, and 383. 
[0016] In still another embodiment, the invention provides 
an antibody which specifically binds PCSK9 comprising a 
VH complementary determining region one (CDRI) having 
the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:8 (SYYMH), 
a VH CDR2 having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ 
ID NO: 9 (EISPFGGRTNYNEKFKS), and/or VH CDR3 hav-

the same binding specificity as the CDR defined by said 
sequences. Preferably, the variant comprises up to about ten 
amino acid substitutions and, more preferably, up to about

the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:12 
(SASYRYT), and/or CDR3 having the amino acid sequence 
shown in SEQ ID NO:13 (QQRYSLWRT), or a variant 
thereof having one or more conservative amino acid substi- 
tutions in said sequences of CDRI, CDR2, and/or CDR3, 
wherein the variant retains essentially the same binding speci- 
ficity as the CDRI defined by said sequences. Preferably, the 
variant comprises up to about ten amino acid substitutions 
and, more preferably, up to about four amino acid substitu- 
tions. 
[0018] In another embodiment, the invention provides an 
antibody comprising specific VL CDRI, CDR2, and/or 
CDR3 sequences, or a variant thereof having one or more

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
[0057] The present invention relates to antibodies, pep- 
tides, and aptamers that antagonize the function of extracel- 
lular PCSK9 including its interaction with the LDLR. More 
specifically, the invention relates to methods of making 
antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers, com- 
positions comprising these antibodies, peptides, and/or 
aptamers, and methods of using these antibodies, peptides, 
and/or aptamers as a medicament. The antagonist PCSK9 
antibodies and peptides can be used to lower blood LDL- 
cholesterol levels, and can be used in the prevention and/or 
treatment of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism disor- 
ders, including familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic 
dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and, more generally, CVD.

DEFINITIONS 
[0059] An "antibody" is an immunoglobulin molecule 
capable of specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, 
polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc. , through at least one 
antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the 
immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encom- 
passes not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, 
but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')~, Fv), 
single chain (ScFv) and domain antibodies), and fusion pro- 
teins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified 
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that com- 
prises an antigen recognition site. An antibody includes an 
antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class 
thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. 
Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the con- 
stant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be 
assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of 
immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several 
of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), 
e. g. , IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAI and IgA2. The heavy- 
chain constant domains that correspond to the different 
classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, 
gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and 
three-dimensional configurations of different classes of 
immunoglobulins are well known. 
[0060] As used herein, "monoclonal antibody" refers to an 
antibody obtained from a population of substantially homo- 
geneous antibodies, i. e. , the individual antibodies comprising 
the population are identical except for possible naturally- 
occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. 
Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed 
against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to 
polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include 
different antibodies directed against different determinants 
(epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a 
single determinant on the antigen. The modifier "mono- 
clonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being 
obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of 
antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production 
of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the 
monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the 
present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first 
described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495, or 
may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as 
described in U. S. Pat. No. 4, 816, 567. The monoclonal anti- 
bodies may also be isolated from phage libraries generated 
using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. , 1990, 
Nature 348:552-554, for example. 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
[0061] As used herein, "humanized" antibody refers to 
forms of non-human (e. g. , murine) antibodies that are chi- 
meric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or frag- 
ments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')~ or other antigen- 
binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal 
sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Prefer- 
ably, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (re- 
cipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary 
determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by 
residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor anti- 
body) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired speci- 
ficity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework 
region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are 
replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Further- 
more, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are 
found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported 
CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further 
refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the 
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least 
one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or 
substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a 
non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the 
FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus 
sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will com- 
prise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region 
or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. 
Preferred are antibodies having Fc regions modified as 
described in WO 99/58572. Other forms of humanized anti- 
bodies have one or more CDRs (CDR Ll, CDR L2, CDR L3, 
CDR Hl, CDR H2, and/or CDR H3) which are altered with 
respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or 
more CDRs "derived from" one or more CDRs from the 
original antibody. 
[0062] As used herein, "human antibody" means an anti- 
body having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of 
an antibody that can be produced by a human and/or which 
has been made using any of the techniques for making human 
antibodies known to those skilled in the art or disclosed 
herein. This definition of a human antibody includes antibod- 
ies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or 
at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such example 
is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human 
heavy chain polypeptides. Human antibodies can be pro- 
duced using various techniques known in the art. In one 
embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage 
library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies 
(Vaughan et al. , 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; 
Sheets et al. , 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 95:6157- 
6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol. , 227:381; 
Marks et al. , 1991, J. Mol. Biol. , 222:581). Human antibodies 
can also be made by immunization of animals into which 
human immunoglobulin loci have been transgenically intro- 
duced in place of the endogenous loci, e. g. , mice in which the 
endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or 
completely inactivated. This approach is described in U. S. 
Pat. Nos. 5, 44, , 877; 5, 44, , 866; 5, 569, 825; 5, 625, 126; 5, 633, 
425; and 5, 661, 016. Alternatively, the human antibody may 
be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that 
produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B 
lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may 
have been immunized in vitro). See, e. g. , Cole et al. Mono- 
clonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77, 
1985; Boerner et al. , 1991, J. Immunol. , 147 (I):86-95; and 
U. S. Pat. No. 5, 750, 373. 
[0063] A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the 
variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable 
region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combi- 
nation. As known in the art, the variable regions of the heavy 
and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) 
connected by three complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs) that contain hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each 
chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, 
with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the forma- 
tion of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at 
least two techniques for determining CDRs: (I) an approach 
based on cross-species sequence variability (ke. , Kabat et al. 
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed. , 
1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md. )); and (2) 
an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen- 
antibody complexes (Al-Iazikani et al, 1997, J. Molec. Biol. 
273:927-948). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs 
defined by either approach or by a combination of both 
approaches. 
[0064] As known in the art a "constant region" of an anti- 
body refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain 
or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either 
alone or in combination. 
[0065] As used herein, the term "PCSK9" refers to any 
form of PCSK9 and variants thereof that retain at least part of 
the activity of PCSK9. Unless indicated differently, such as 
by specific reference to human PCSK9, PCSK9 includes all 
mammalian species of native sequence PCSK9, e. g. , human, 
canine, feline, equine, and bovine. One exemplary human 
PCSK9 is found as Uniprot Accession Number Q8NBP7 
(SEQ ID NO:16). 
[0066] As used herein, a "PCSK9 antagonist" refers to an 
antibody, peptide, or aptamer that is able to inhibit PCSK9 
biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated 
by PCSK9 signaling, including PCSK9-mediated down- 
regulation of the LDLR, and PCSK9-mediated decrease in 
LDL blood clearance. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody encom- 
passes antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce 
(to any degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological 
activity, including downstream pathways mediated by 
PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicita- 
tion of a cellular response to PCSK9. For purpose of the 
present invention, it will be explicitly understood that the 
term "PCSK9 antagonist antibody" encompasses all the pre- 
viously identified terms, titles, and functional states and char- 
acteristics whereby the PCSK9 itself, a PCSK9 biological 
activity (including but not limited to its ability to mediate any 
aspect of interaction with the LDLR, down regulation of 
LDLR, and decreased blood LDL clearance), or the conse- 
quences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified, 
decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree. In some 
embodiments, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds PCSK9 
and prevents interaction with the LDLR. Examples of PCSK9 
antagonist antibodies are provided herein. 
[0067] As used herein a "full antagonist" is an antagonist 
which, at an effective concentration, essentially completely 
blocks a measurable effect of PCSK9. By a partial antagonist 
is meant an antagonist that is capable of partially blocking a 
measurable effect, but that, even at a highest concentration is 
not a full antagonist. By essentially completely is meant at 
least about 80%, preferably, at least about 90%, more prefer- 
ably, at least about 95%, and most preferably, at least about 
98% or 99% of the measurable effect is blocked. The relevant 
"measurable effects" are described herein and include down 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
regulation of LDLR by a PCSK9 antagonist as assayed in 
Huh7 cells in vitro, in vivo decrease in blood (or plasma) 
levels of total cholesterol, and in vivo decrease in LDL levels 
in blood (or plasma). 
[006S] As used herein, the term "clinically meaningful" 
means at least a 15% reduction in blood LDL-cholesterol 
levels in humans or at least a 15% reduction in total blood 
cholesterol in mice. It is clear that measurements in plasma or 
serum can serve as surrogates for measurement of levels in 
blood. 
[0069] As used herein, the term "PCSK9 antagonist pep- 
tide" or "PCSK9 antagonist aptamer" includes any conven- 
tional peptide or polypeptide or aptamer that blocks, antago- 
nizes, suppresses or reduces (to any degree including 
significantly) PCSK9 biological activity, including down- 
stream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as 
LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular response to 
PCSK9. PCSK9 antagonist peptides or polypeptides include 
Fc fusions comprising the LDLR and soluble portions of the 
LDLR, or mutants thereof with higher affinity to PCSK9. 
[0070] The terms "polypeptide", "oligopeptide", "peptide" 
and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to 
chains of amino acids of any length, preferably, relatively 
short (e. g. , 10-100 amino acids). The chain may be linear or 
branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and/or may 
be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass 
an amino acid chain that has been modified naturally or by 
intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glyco- 
sylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any 
other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with 
a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, 
for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of 
an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino 
acids, etc. ), as well as other modifications known in the art. It 
is understood that the polypeptides can occur as single chains 
or associated chains. 
[0071] As known in the art, "polynucleotide, " or "nucleic 
acid, " as used interchangeably herein, refer to chains o f nucle- 
otides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucle- 
otides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modi- 
fied nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any 
substrate that can be incorporated into a chain by DNA or 
RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide may comprise modified 
nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their ana- 
logs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may 
be imparted before or after assembly of the chain. The 
sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucle- 
otide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified 
after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling 
component. Other types of modifications include, for 
example, "caps", substitution of one or more of the naturally 
occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modi- 
fications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages 
(e. g. , methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoami- 
dates, carbamates, etc. ) and with charged linkages (e. g. , phos- 
phorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc. ), those containing 
pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e. g. , 
nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, 
etc. ), those with intercalators (e. g. , acridine, psoralen, etc. ), 
those containing chelators (e. g. , metals, radioactive metals, 
boron, oxidative metals, etc. ), those containing alkylators, 
those with modified linkages (e. g. , alpha anomeric nucleic 
acids, etc. ), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide 
(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in 
the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate 
groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting 
groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to addi- 
tional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. 
The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substi- 
tuted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 
I to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be deriva- 
tized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also 
contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that 
are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-0- 
methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic 
sugar analogs, alpha- or beta-anomeric sugars, epimeric sug- 
ars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, 
furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic 
nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more 
phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative link- 
ing groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are 
not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced 
by P(O)S("thioate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"), (O)NR~ ("ami- 
date"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH~ ("formacetal"), in which 
each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubsti- 
tuted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (~ ) 
linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. 
Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The 
preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred 
to herein, including RNA and DNA. 
[0072] A "PCSK9 antagonist aptamer, " which comprises a 
nucleic acid or protein sequence, is, for example, selected 
from a large pool of random sequences and specifically binds 
PCSK9. The nucleic acid of the aptamer is double-stranded 
DNA or single-strand RNA. Nucleic acid aptamers can 
include modified bases or functional groups, including but 
not limited to 2'-fluorine nucleotides and 2'-0-methyl nucle- 
otides. Aptamers can include hydrophilic polymers, for 
example, polyethylene glycol. Aptamers may be made by 
methods known in the art and selected for PCSK9 antagonist 
activity by routine modification of the methods disclosed in 
the Examples. 
[0073] As used herein, an antibody, peptide, or aptamer 
"interacts with" PCSK9 when the equilibrium dissociation 
constant is equal to or less than 20 nM, preferably less than 
about 6 nM, more preferably less than about I nM, most 
preferably less than about 0. 2 nM, as measured by the meth- 
ods disclosed herein in Example 2. 
[0074] An epitope that "preferentially binds" or "specifi- 
cally binds" (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a 
polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods 
to determine such specific or preferential binding are also 
well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit "specific 
binding" or "preferential binding" if it reacts or associates 
more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or 
with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it 
does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody "spe- 
cifically binds" or "preferentially binds" to a target if it binds 
with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater 
duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an 
antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to a PCSK9 
epitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater 
affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration 
than it binds to other PCSK9 epitopes or non-PCSK9 
epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, 
for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifi- 
cally or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not 
specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
"specific binding" or "preferential binding" does not neces- 
sarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. 
Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means 
preferential binding. 
[0075] As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to mate- 
rial which is at least 50% pure (ke. , free from contaminants), 
more preferably, at least 90% pure, more preferably, at least 
95% pure, yet more preferably, at least 98% pure, and most 
preferably, at least 99% pure. 
[0076] A "host cell" includes an individual cell or cell 
culture that can be or has been a recipient for vector(s) for 
incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include 
progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not nec- 
essarily be completely identical (in morphology or in 
genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to 
natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell 
includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of 
this invention. 
[0077] As known in the art, the term "Fc region" is used to 
define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy 
chain. The "Fc region" may be a native sequence Fc region or 
a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region 
of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human 
IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from 
an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to 
the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The numbering of the residues 
in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat. Kabat et 
al. , Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. 
Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, 
Bethesda, Md. , 1991. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin 
generally comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. 
[0078] As used in the art, "Fc receptor" and "FcR" describe 
a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The 
preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a 
preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma 
receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc7RI, Fc7RII, and 
Fc7RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alterna- 
tively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc7RII receptors 
include Fc7RIIA (an "activating receptor") and Fc7RIIB (an 
"inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid 
sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains 
thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. 
Rev. Immunol. , 9:457-92; Capel et al. , 1994, Immu- 
nomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al. , 1995, J. Lab. Clin. 
Med. , 126:330-41. "FcR" also includes the neonatal receptor, 
FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs 
to the fetus (Guyer et al. , 1976 J. Immunol. , 117: 587; and Kim 
et al. , 1994, J. Immunol. , 24:249). 
[0079] The term "compete", as used herein with regard to 
an antibody, means that a first antibody, or an antigen-binding 
portion thereof, binds to an epitope in a manner sufficiently 
similar to the binding of a second antibody, or an antigen- 
binding portion thereof, such that the result of binding of the 
first antibody with its cognate epitope is detectably decreased 
in the presence of the second antibody compared to the bind- 
ing of the first antibody in the absence of the second antibody. 
The alternative, where the binding of the second antibody to 
its epitope is also detectably decreased in the presence of the 
first antibody, can, but need not be the case. That is, a first 
antibody can inhibit the binding of a second antibody to its 
epitope without that second antibody inhibiting the binding of 
the first antibody to its respective epitope. However, where 
each antibody detectably inhibits the binding of the other 
antibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the 
same, greater, or lesser extent, the antibodies are said to 
"cross-compete" with each other for binding of their respec- 
tive epitope(s). Both competing and cross-competing anti- 
bodies are encompassed by the present invention. Regardless 
of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-com- 
petition occurs (e. g. , steric hindrance, conformational 
change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereo fJ, 
the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the teachings 
provided herein, that such competing and/or cross-competing 
antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the meth- 
ods disclosed herein. 
[0080] By an antibody with an epitope that "overlaps" with 
another (second) epitope or with a surface on PCSK9 that 
interacts with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR is meant the 
sharing of space in terms of the PCSK9 residues that are 
interacted with. To calculate the percent of overlap, for 
example, the percent overlap of the claimed antibody's 
PCSK9 epitope with the surface of PCSK9 which interacts 
with the EGF-like domain of the LDLR, the surface area of 
PCSK9 buried when in complex with the LDLR is calculated 
on a per-residue basis. The buried area is also calculated for 
these residues in the PCSK9:antibody complex. To prevent 
more than 100% possible overlap, surface area for residues 
that have higher buried surface area in the PCSK9:antibody 
complex than in LDLR:PCSK9 complex is set to values from 
the LDLR:PCSK9 complex (100%). Percent surface overlap 
is calculated by summing over all of the LDLR PCSK9 inter- 
acting residues and is weighted by the interaction area. 
[0081] A "functional Fc region" possesses at least one 
effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary 
"effector functions" include Clq binding; complement depen- 
dent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity; phagocytosis; down-regulation of 
cell surface receptors (e. g. , B cell receptor), etc. Such effector 
functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with 
a binding domain (e. g. , an antibody variable domain) and can 
be assessed using various assays known in the art for evalu- 
ating such antibody effector functions. 
[0082] A "native sequence Fc region" comprises an amino 
acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc 
region found in nature. A "variant Fc region" comprises an 
amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native 
sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid 
modification, yet retains at least one effector function of the 
native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region 
has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native 
sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, 
e. g. , from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and 
preferably, from about one to about five amino acid substitu- 
tions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the 
parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will prefer- 
ably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a 
native sequence F c region and/or with an F c region of a parent 
polypeptide, and most preferably, at least about 90% 
sequence identity therewith, more preferably, at least about 
95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 
98%, at least about 99% sequence identity therewith. 
[0083] As used herein, "treatment" is an approach for 
obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes 
of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, 
but are not limited to, one or more of the following: enhance- 
ment of LDL clearance and reducing incidence or ameliora- 
tion of aberrant cholesterol and/or lipoprotein levels resulting 
from metabolic and/or eating disorders, or including familial 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, atheroscle- 
rosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
[0084] "Reducing incidence" means any of reducing sever- 
ity (which can include reducing need for and/or amount of 
(e. g. , exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used 
for this condition. As is understood by those skilled in the art, 
individuals may vary in terms of their response to treatment, 
and, as such, for example, a "method of reducing incidence" 
reflects administering the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, pep- 
tide, or aptamer based on a reasonable expectation that such 
administration may likely cause such a reduction in incidence 
in that particular individual. 
[0085] "Ameliorating" means a lessening or improvement 
of one or more symptoms as compared to not administering a 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. "Ameliorat- 
ing" also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a 
symptom. 
[0086] As used herein, an "effective dosage" or "effective 
amount" of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition 
is an amount sufficient to effect any one or more beneficial or 
desired results. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired 
results include eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the 
severity, or delaying the outset of the disease, including bio- 
chemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the 
disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phe- 
notypes presenting during development of the disease. For 
therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical 
results such as reducing hypercholesterolemia or one or more 
symptoms of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD, or coro- 
nary heart disease, decreasing the dose of other medications 
required to treat the disease, enhancing the effect of another 
medication, and/or delaying the progression of the disease of 
patients. An effective dosage can be administered in one or 
more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an 
effective dosage of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical com- 
position is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or 
therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is under- 
stood in the clinical context, an effective dosage of a drug, 
compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not 
be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or 
pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an "effective dosage" 
may be considered in the context of administering one or 
more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be consid- 
ered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with 
one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is 
achieved. 
[0087] An "individual" or a "subject" is a mammal, more 
preferably, a human. Mammals also include, but are not lim- 
ited to, farm animals, sport animals, pets, primates, horses, 
dogs, cats, mice and rats. 
[00SS] As usedherein, "vector" means a construct, whichis 
capable of delivering, and, preferably, expressing, one or 
more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. 
Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral 
vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, 
cosmid or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors 
associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or RNA 
expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain 
eukaryotic cells, such as producer cells. 
[0089] As used herein, "expression control sequence" 
means a nucleic acid sequence that directs transcription of a 
nucleic acid. An expression control sequence can be a pro- 
moter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an 
enhancer. The expression control sequence is operably linked 
to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed. 
[0090] As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable car- 
rier" or "pharmaceutical acceptable excipient" includes any 
material which, when combined with an active ingredient, 
allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non- 
reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples 
include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharma- 
ceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, 
water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various 
types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or 
parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS) or normal (0. 9%) saline. Compositions comprising 
such carriers are formulated by well known conventional 
methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sci- 
ences, 18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed. , Mack Publishing Co. , 
Easton, Pa. , 1990; and Remington, The Science and Practice 
of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. , Mack Publishing, 2000). 
[0091] The term "K ", as used herein, refers to the rate 
constant for association of an antibody to an antigen. Specifi- 
cally, the rate constants (k and k +) and equilibrium disso- 
ciation constants are measured using Fab antibody fragments 
(Le. , univalent) and PCSK9. 
[0092] The term "k +', as used herein, refers to the rate 
constant for dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/ 
antigen complex. 
[0093] The term "K~", as used herein, refers to the equilib- 
rium dissociation constant o f an antibody-antigen interaction. 
A. Methods for Preventing or Treating Disorders Associated 
with Hypercholesterolemia 
[0094] In one aspect, the invention provides a method for 
treating or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least 
one symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coro- 
nary heart disease, in an individual comprising administering 
to the individual an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist 
antibody or peptide or aptamer that antagonizes circulating 
PCSK9. 
[0095] In a further aspect, the invention provides an effec- 
tive amount of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or 
aptamer that antagonizes circulating PCSK9 for use in treat- 
ing or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least one 
symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coronary 
heart disease, in an individual. The invention further provides 
the use of an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body, peptide, or aptamer that antagonizes extracellular or 
circulating PCSK9 in the manufacture of a medicament for 
treating or preventing hypercholesterolemia, and/or at least 
one symptom of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, CVD or coro- 
nary heart disease, in an individual. 
[0096] Advantageously, therapeutic administration of the 
antibody, peptide, or aptamer results in lower blood choles- 
terol and/or lower blood LDL. Preferably, blood cholesterol 
and/or blood LDL is at least about 10% or 15% lower than 
before administration. More preferably, blood cholesterol 
and/or blood LDL is at least about 20% lower than before 
administration of the antibody. Yet more preferably, blood 
cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 30% lower than 
before administration of the antibody. Advantageously, blood 
cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 40% lower than 
before administration of the antibody. More advantageously, 
blood cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 50% lower than 
before administration of the antibody. Very preferably, blood 
cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 60% lower than 
before administration of the antibody. Most preferably, blood 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
cholesterol and/or blood LDL is at least 70% lower than 
before administration of the antibody. 
[0097] With respect to all methods described herein, refer- 
ence to PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, peptides, and aptamers 
also include compositions comprising one or more additional 
agents. These compositions may further comprise suitable 
excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients 
including buffers, which are well known in the art. The 
present invention can be used alone or in combination with 
other conventional methods o f treatment. 
[0098] The PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or 
aptamer can be administered to an individual via any suitable 
route. It should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that 
the examples described herein are not intended to be limiting 
but to be illustrative of the techniques available. Accordingly, 
in some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, pep- 
tide, or aptamer is administered to an individual in accord 
with known methods, such as intravenous administration, 
e. g. , as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of 
time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerebrospinal, 
transdermal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, sublingually, 
intrasynovial, via insufflation, intrathecal, oral, inhalation or 
topical routes. Administration can be systemic, e. g. , intrave- 
nous administration, or localized. Commercially available 
nebulizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers 
and ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liq- 
uid formulations can be directly nebulized and lyophilized 
powder can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively, 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can be aero- 
solized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a metered dose 
inhaler, or inhaled as a lyophilized and milled powder. 
[0099] In one embodiment, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, 
peptide, or aptamer is administered via site-specific or tar- 
geted local delivery techniques. Examples of site-specific or 
targeted local delivery techniques include various implant- 
able depot sources of the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, pep- 
tide, or aptamer or local delivery catheters, such as infusion 
catheters, indwelling catheters, or needle catheters, synthetic 
grafts, adventitial wraps, shunts and stents or other implant- 
able devices, site specific carriers, direct injection, or direct 
application. See, e. g. , PCT Publ. No. WO 00/53211 and U. S. 
Pat. No. 5, 981, 568. 
[0100] Various formulations of a PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body, peptide, or aptamer may be used for administration. In 
some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, 
or aptamer may be administered neat. In some embodiments, 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer and a phar- 
maceutically acceptable excipient may be in various formu- 
lations. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are known in 
the art, and are relatively inert substances that facilitate 
administration of a pharmacologically effective substance. 
For example, an excipient can give form or consistency, or act 
as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to 
stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for 
varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin 
penetration enhancers. Excipients as well as formulations for 
parenteral and nonparenteral drug delivery are set forth in 
Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. , 
Mack Publishing (2000). These agents can be combined with 
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such as saline, Ringer's 
solution, dextrose solution, and the like. The particular dos- 
age regimen, i. e. , dose, timing and repetition, will depend on 
the particular individual and that individual's medical history. 
[0101] PCSK9 antibodies can also be administered via 
inhalation, as described herein. Generally, for administration 
o f PC SK9 antibodies, an initial candidate dosage can be about 
2 mg/kg. For the purpose of the present invention, a typical 
daily dosage might range from about any of about 3 pg/kg to 
30 pg/kg to 300 pg/kg to 3 mg/kg, to 30 mg/kg, to 100 mg/kg 
or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For 
example, dosage of about I mg/kg, about 2. 5 mg/kg, about 5 
mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, and about 25 mg/kg may be used. For 
repeated administrations over several days or longer, depend- 
ing on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired 
suppression of symptoms occurs or until sufficient therapeu- 
tic levels are achieved, for example, to reduce blood LDL 
levels. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administer- 
ing an initial dose of about 2 mg/kg, followed by a weekly 
maintenance dose of about I mg/kg of the PCSK9 antibody, 
or followed by a maintenance dose of about I mg/kg every 
other week. However, other dosage regimens may be useful, 
depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the 
practitioner wishes to achieve. For example, in some embodi- 
ments, dosing from one to four times a week is contemplated. 
In other embodiments dosing once a month or once every 
other month or every three months is contemplated. The 
progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional 
techniques and assays. The dosing regimen (including the 
PCSK9 antagonist(s) used) can vary over time. 
[0102] For the purpose of the present invention, the appro- 
priate dosage of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or 
aptamer will depend on the PCSK9 antagonist antibody, pep- 
tide, or aptamer (or compositions thereof) employed, the type 
and severity of symptoms to be treated, whether the agent is 
administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous 
therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the 
agent, the patient's blood PCSK9 levels, the patient's synthe- 
sis and clearance rate for PCSK9, the patient's clearance rate 
for the administered agent, and the discretion of the attending 
physician. Typically the clinician will administer a PCSK9 
antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer until a dosage is 
reached that achieves the desired result. Dose and/or fre- 
quency can vary over course of treatment. Empirical consid- 
erations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to the 
determination of the dosage. For example, antibodies that are 
compatible with the human immune system, such as human- 
ized antibodies or fully human antibodies, may be used to 
prolong half-life of the antibody and to prevent the antibody 
being attacked by the host's immune system. Frequency of 
administration may be determined and adjusted over the 
course of therapy, and is generally, but not necessarily, based 
on treatment and/or suppression and/or amelioration and/or 
delay of symptoms, e. g. , hypercholesterolemia. Alterna- 
tively, sustained continuous release formulations of PCSK9 
antagonist antibodies may be appropriate. Various formula- 
tions and devices for achieving sustained release are known in 
the art. 
[0103] In one embodiment, dosages for an antagonist anti- 
body, peptide, or aptamer may be determined empirically in 
individuals who have been given one or more administration 
(s) of an antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer. Individuals 
are given incremental dosages of a PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body, peptide, or aptamer. To assess efficacy, an indicator of 
the disease can be followed. 
[0104] Administration of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, 
peptide, or aptamer in accordance with the method in the 
present invention can be continuous or intermittent, depend- 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
10 
Mar. 18, 2010 
ing, for example, upon the recipient's physiological condi- 
tion, whether the purpose of the administration is therapeutic 
or prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled practitio- 
ners. The administration of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, 
peptide, or aptamer may be essentially continuous over a 
preselected period of time or may be in a series of spaced 
doses. 
[0105] In some embodiments, more than one antagonist 
antibody, peptide, or aptamer may be present. At least one, at 
least two, at least three, at least four, at least five different, or 
more antagonist antibodies and/or peptides can be present. 
Generally, those PCSK9 antagonist antibodies or peptides 
may have complementary activities that do not adversely 
affect each other. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or 
aptamer can also be used in conjunction with other PCSK9 
antagonists or PCSK9 receptor antagonists. For example, one 
or more of the following PCSK9 antagonists may be used: an 
antisense molecule directed to a PCSK9 (including an anti- 
sense molecule directed to a nucleic acid encoding PCSK9), 
a PCSK9 inhibitory compound, and a PCSK9 structural ana- 
log. A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer can 
also be used in conjunction with other agents that serve to 
enhance and/or complement the effectiveness of the agents. 
[0106] Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are 
nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations 
employed, and may comprise buffers such as phosphate, cit- 
rate, and other organic acids; salts such as sodium chloride; 
antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preser- 
vatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chlo- 
ride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, ben- 
zethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl 
parabens, such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resor- 
cinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecu- 
lar weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; pro- 
teins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; 
hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino 
acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, argi- 
nine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other 
carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; 
chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, man- 
nitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as 
sodium; metal complexes (e. g. , Zn-protein complexes); and/ 
or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN, PLURONICS™ 
or polyethylene glycol (PEG). 
[0107] Liposomes containing the PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body, peptide, or aptamer are prepared by methods known in 
the art, such as described in Epstein, et al. , 1985, Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688; Hwang, et al. , 1980, Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030; and U. S. Pat. Nos. 4, 485, 045 and 
4, 544, 545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are 
disclosed in U. S. Pat. No. 5, 013, 556. Particularly useful lipo- 
somes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation 
method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidyl- 
choline, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidyletha- 
nolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters 
of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diam- 
eter. 
[0108] The active ingredients may also be entrapped in 
microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation tech- 
niques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, 
hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly- 
(methylmethacrylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloi- 
dal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin 
microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocap- 
sules) or in macro emulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 
Remingon, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. , 
Mack Publishing (2000). 
[0109] Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. 
Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include 
semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers con- 
taining the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped 
articles, e. g. , films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained- 
release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, 
poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or 'poly(vinylalcohol)), 
polylactides (U. S. Pat. No. 3, 773, 919), copolymers of 
L-glutamic acid and 7 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable 
ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid 
copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable 
microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copoly- 
mer and leuprolide acetate), sucrose acetate isobutyrate, and 
poly-D-( — )-3-hydroxybutyric acid. 
[0110] The formulations to be used for in vivo administra- 
tion must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by, for 
example, filtration through sterile filtration membranes. 
Therapeutic PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer 
compositions are generally placed into a container having a 
sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag 
or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection 
needle. 
[0111] Suitable emulsions may be prepared using commer- 
cially available fat emulsions, such as Intralipid™, Lipo- 
syn™, Infonutrol™, Lipofundin™ and Lipiphysan™. The 
active ingredient may be either dissolved in a pre-mixed 
emulsion composition or alternatively it may be dissolved in 
an oil (e. g. , soybean oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, sesame 
oil, corn oil or almond oil) and an emulsion formed upon 
mixing with a phospholipid (e. g. , egg phospholipids, soybean 
phospholipids or soybean lecithin) and water. It will be appre- 
ciated that other ingredients may be added, for example glyc- 
erol or glucose, to adjust the tonicity of the emulsion. Suitable 
emulsions will typically contain up to 20'zo oil, for example, 
between 5 and 20'zo. The fat emulsion can comprise fat drop- 
lets between 0. 1 and 1. 0 pm, particularly 0. 1 and 0. 5 pm, and 
have a pH in the range of 5. 5 to 8. 0. 
[0112] The emulsion compositions can be those prepared 
by mixing a PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer 
with Intralipid™ or the components thereof (soybean oil, egg 
phospholipids, glycerol and water). 
[0113] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include 
solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, 
aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and pow- 
ders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable 
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as set out above. In 
some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the 
oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. 
Compositions in preferably sterile pharmaceutically accept- 
able solvents may be nebulised by use of gases. Nebulised 
solutions may be breathed directly from the nebuli sing device 
or the nebulising device may be attached to a face mask, tent 
or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, 
suspension or powder compositions may be administered, 
preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the 
formulation in an appropriate manner. 
B. PCSK9 Antagonists 
[0114] The methods of the invention use a PCSK9 antago- 
nist antibody, peptide, or aptamer, which refers to any peptide 
or nucleic acid molecule that blocks, suppresses or reduces 
US 2010/0068199 A1 Mar. 18, 2010 
(including significantly reduces) PCSK9 biological activity, 
including downstream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signal- 
ing, such as elicitation of a cellular response to PCSK9. 
[0115] A PCSK9 antagonist antibody, peptide, or aptamer 
should exhibit any one or more of the following characteris- 
tics: (a) bind to PCSK9; (b) block PCSK9 interaction with the 
LDLR; (c) block or decrease PCSK9-mediated down-regula- 
tion of the LDLR; (d) inhibit the PCSK9-mediated decrease 
in LDL blood clearance, (e) increase LDL clearance in media 
by cultured hepatocytes, (fJ increase blood LDL clearance by 
the liver in vivo, (g) sensitize to statins, and (h) block PCSK9 
interaction with other yet to be identified factors. 
[0116] Forpurposes ofthis invention, the antibody, peptide, 
or aptamer preferably reacts with PCSK9 in a manner that 
inhibits PCSK9 signaling function and LDLR interaction. In 
some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody specifi- 
cally recognizes primate PCSK9. In some embodiments, the 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds primate and rodent 
PCSK9. 
[0117] The antibodies useful in the present invention can 
encompass monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, 
antibody fragments (e. g. , Fab, Fab', F(ab')~, Fv, Fc, etc. ), 
chimeric antibodies, bispecific antibodies, heteroconjugate 
antibodies, single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion pro- 
teins comprising an antibody portion (e. g. , a domain anti- 
body), human antibodies, humanized antibodies, and any 
other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin mol- 
ecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the 
required specificity, including glycosylation variants of anti- 
bodies, amino acid sequence variants of antibodies, and 
covalently modified antibodies. The antibodies may be 
murine, rat, human, or any other origin (including chimeric or 
humanized antibodies). 
[0118] In some embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body is a monoclonal antibody. The PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body can also be humanized. In other embodiments, the anti- 
body is human. 
[0119] In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a 
modified constant region, such as a constant region that is 
immunologically inert, that is, having a reduced potential for 
provoking an immune response. In some embodiments, the 
constant region is modified as described in Eur. J. Immunol. , 
1999, 29:2613-2624; PCT Publ. No. WO99/58572; and/or 
UK Patent Application No. 9809951. 8. The Fc can be human 
IgG2 or human IgG4. The Fc can be human IgG2 containing 
the mutation A330P331 to S330S331 (IgG~~ ), in which the 
amino acid residues are numbered with reference to the wild 
type IgG2 sequence. Eur. J. Immunol. , 1999, 29:2613-2624. 
In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a constant 
region of IgG4 comprising the following mutations (Armour 
et al. , 2003, Molecular Immunology 40 585-593): 
E233F234L235 to P233V234A235 (IgG«), in which the 
numbering is with reference to wild type IgG4. In yet another 
embodiment, the Fc is human IgG4 E233F234L235 to 
P233V234A235 with deletion G236 (IgG«b). In another 
embodiment the Fc is any human IgG4 Fc (IgG4, IgG«b or 
IgG«) containing hinge stabilizing mutation S228 to P228 
(Aalberse et al. , 2002, Immunology 105, 9-19). In another 
embodiment, the Fc can be aglycosylated Fc. 
[0120] In some embodiments, the constant region is agly- 
cosylated by mutating the oligo saccharide attachment residue 
(such as Asn297) and/or flanking residues that are part of the 
glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region. In 
some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated for 
N-linked glycosylation enzymatically. The constant region 
may be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymati- 
cally or by expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell. 
[0121] The binding affinity (K~) of a PCSK9 antagonist 
antibody to PCSK9 (such as human PCSK9)) can be about 
0. 002 to about 200 nM. In some embodiments, the binding 
affinity is any of about 200 nM, about 100 nM, about 50 nM, 
about 10 nM, about I nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, about 
60 pM, about 50 pM, about 20 pM, about 15 pM, about 10 
pM, about 5 pM, or about 2 pM. In some embodiments, the 
binding affinity is less than any of about 250 nM, about 200 
nM, about 100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about I nM, 
about 500 pM, about 100 pM, about 50 pM, about 20 pM, 
about 10 pM, about 5 pM, or about 2 pM. 
[0122] One way of determining binding affinity of antibod- 
ies to PCSK9 is by measuring binding affinity of monofunc- 
tional Fab fragments of the antibody. To obtain monofunc- 
tional Fab fragments, an antibody (for example, IgG) can be 
cleaved with papain or expressed recombinantly. The affinity 
of a PCSK9 Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined 
by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore3000™ surface plas- 
mon resonance (SPR) system, Biacore, INC, Piscataway 
N. J. ) equipped with pre-immobilized streptavidin sensor 
chips (SA) using HBS-EP running buffer (0. 01M HEPES, pH 
7. 4, 0. 15 NaCI, 3 mM EDTA, 0. 005% v/v Surfactant P20). 
Biotinylated human PCSK9 (or any other PCSK9) can be 
diluted into HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of less than 05 
pg/mL and injected across the individual chip channels using 
variable contact times, to achieve two ranges of antigen den- 
sity, either 50-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic 
studies or 800-1, 000 RU for screening assays. Regeneration 
studies have shown that 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol 
effectively removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity 
of PCSK9 on the chip for over 200 injections. Typically, serial 
dilutions (spanning concentrations of 0. 1-10x estimated K~) 
of purified Fab samples are injected for I min at 100 
pL/minute and dissociation times o f up to 2 hours are allowed. 
The concentrations of the Fab proteins are determined by 
ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of 
known concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis) 
as a standard. Kinetic association rates (k ) and dissociation 
rates (k &) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data 
globally to a I: I Langmuir binding model (Karls son, R. Roos, 
H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B. , 1994. Methods Enzymology 
6. 99-110) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium 
dissociation constant (K~) values are calculated as k + 
This protocol is suitable for use in determining binding affin- 
ity of an antibody to any PCSK9, including human PCSK9, 
PCSK9 of another mammalian (such as mouse PCSK9, rat 
PCSK9, primate PCSK9), as well as different forms of 
PCSK9 (such as u and [3 form). Binding affinity of an anti- 
body is generally measured at 25' C. , but can also be mea- 
sured at 37' C. 
[0123] The PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be made by 
any method known in the art including the method as pro- 
vided in Example 1. The route and schedule of immunization 
of the host animal are generally in keeping with established 
and conventional techniques for antibody stimulation and 
production, as further described herein. General techniques 
for production of human and mouse antibodies are known in 
the art and/or are described herein. A currently preferred 
method of making the antibodies comprises the immuniza- 
tion of PCSK9 knockout (PCSK9 — / — ) animals as disclosed 
herein. 
US 2010/0068199 A1

[0124] It is contemplated that any mammalian subject 
including humans or antibody producing cells therefrom can 
be manipulated to serve as the basis for production of mam- 
malian, including human, hybridoma cell lines. Typically, the 
host animal is inoculated intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, 
orally, subcutaneously, intraplantar, and/or intradermally 
with an amount of immunogen, including as described herein. 
[0125] Hybridomas can be prepared from the lymphocytes 
and immortalized myeloma cells using the general somatic 
cell hybridization technique of Kohler, B. and Milstein, C. , 
1975, Nature 256:495-497 or as modified by Buck, D. W. , et 
al. , 1982, In Vitro, 18:377-381. Available myeloma lines, 
including but not limited to X63-Ag8. 653 and those from the 
Salk Institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. , 
USA, may be used in the hybridization. Generally, the tech- 
nique involves fusing myeloma cells and lymphoid cells 
using a fusogen such as polyethylene glycol, or by electrical 
means well known to those skilled in the art. After the fusion, 
the cells are separated from the fusion medium and grown in 
a selective growth medium, such as hypoxanthine-aminop- 
terin-thymidine (HAT) medium, to eliminate unhybridized 
parent cells. Any of the media described herein, supple- 
mented with or without serum, can be used for culturing 
hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibodies. As another 
alternative to the cell fusion technique, EBV immortalized B 
cells may be used to produce the PCSK9 monoclonal anti- 
bodies of the subject invention. The hybridomas are expanded 
and subcloned, if desired, and supernatants are assayed for 
anti-immunogen activity by conventional immunoassay pro- 
cedures (e. g. , radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or 
fluorescence immunoassay). 
[0126] Hybridomas that may be used as a source of anti- 
bodies encompass all derivatives, progeny cells of the parent 
hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies specific for 
PCSK9, or a portion thereof. 
[0127] Hybridomas that produce such antibodies may be 
grown in vitro or in vivo using known procedures. The mono- 
clonal antibodies may be isolated from the culture media or 
body fluids, by conventional immunoglobulin purification 
procedures such as ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel elec- 
trophoresis, dialysis, chromatography, and ultrafiltration, if 
desired. Undesired activity, if present, can be removed, for 
example, by running the preparation over adsorbents made of 
the immunogen attached to a solid phase and eluting or releas- 
ing the desired antibodies off the immunogen. Immunization 
of a host animal with a human PCSK9, or a fragment con- 
taining the target amino acid sequence conjugated to a protein 
that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e. g. , 
keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyro- 
globulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or 
derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuc- 
cinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hy- 
droxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, 
succinic anhydride, SOCI~, or R'N C NR, where R and 
R' are different alkyl groups, can yield a population of anti- 
bodies (e. g. , monoclonal antibodies). 
[0128] If desired, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody (mono- 
clonal or polyclonal) of interest may be sequenced and the 
polynucleotide sequence may then be cloned into a vector for 
expression or propagation. The sequence encoding the anti- 
body of interest may be maintained in vector in a host cell and 
the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use. 
Production of recombinant mono clonal antibodies in cell cul- 
ture can be carried out through cloning of antibody genes 
from B cells by means known in the art. See, e. g. , Tiller et al. , 
2008, J. Immunol. Methods 329, 112; U. S. Pat. No. 7, 314, 
622. 
[0129] In an alternative, the polynucleotide sequence may 
be used for genetic manipulation to "humanize" the antibody 
or to improve the affinity, or other characteristics of the anti- 
body. For example, the constant region may be engineered to 
more nearly resemble human constant regions to avoid 
immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and 
treatments in humans. It may be desirable to genetically 
manipulate the antibody sequence to obtain greater affinity to 
PCSK9 and greater efficacy in inhibiting PCSK9. It will be 
apparent to one of skill in the art that one or more polynucle- 
otide changes can be made to the PCSK9 antagonist antibody 
and still maintain its binding ability to PCSK9. 
[0130] There are four general steps to humanize a mono- 
clonal antibody. These are: (I) determining the nucleotide 
and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody 
light and heavy variable domains; (2) designing the human- 
ized antibody, i. e. , deciding which antibody framework 
region to use during the humanizing process; (3) the actual 
humanizing methodologies/techniques; and (4) the transfec- 
tion and expression of the humanized antibody. See, for 
example, U. S. Pat. Nos. 4, 816, 567; 5, 807, 715; 5, 866, 692; 
6, 331, 415; 5, 300, 011; 5, 693, 761; 5, 693, 762; 5, 88, , 899; and 
6, 180, 370. 
[0131] A number of "humanized" antibody molecules 
comprising an antigen-binding site derived from a non-hu- 
man immunoglobulin have been described, including chi- 
meric antibodies having rodent or modified rodent V regions 
and their associated CDRs fused to human constant domains. 
See, for example, Winter et al. , 1991, Nature 349:293-299; 
Lobuglio et al. , 1989, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220- 
4224; Shaw et al. , 1987, J Immunol. 138:4534-4538; and 
Brown et al. , 1987, Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583. Other refer- 
ences describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting 
framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate 
human antibody constant domain. See, for example, Riech- 
mann et al. , 1988, Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. , 
1988, Science 239:1534-1536; and Jones et al. , 1986, Nature 
321:522-525. Another reference describes rodent CDRs sup- 
ported by recombinantly engineered rodent framework 
regions. See, for example, European Patent Publ. No. 
0519596. These "humanized" molecules are designed to 
minimize unwanted immunological response toward rodent 
anti-human antibody molecules which limits the duration and 
effectiveness of therapeutic applications of those moieties in 
human recipients. For example, the antibody constant region 
can be engineered such that it is immunologically inert (e. g. , 
does not trigger complement lysis). See, e. g. , PCT Publ. No. 
WO99/58572; UK Patent Application No. 9809951. 8. Other 
methods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized 
are disclosed by Daugherty et al. , 1991, Nucl. Acids Res. 
19:2471-2476 and in U. S. Pat. Nos. 6, 180, 377; 6, 054, 297; 
5, 997, 867; 5, 866, 692; 6, 210, 671; and 6, 350, 861; and in PCT 
Publ. No. WO 01/27160. 
[0132] In yet another alternative, fully human antibodies 
may be obtained by using commercially available mice that 
have been engineered to express specific human immunoglo- 
bulin proteins. Transgenic animals that are designed to pro- 
duce a more desirable or more robust immune response may 
also be used for generation of humanized or human antibod- 
ies. Examples of such technology are Xenomouse™ from 
Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif. ), HuMAb-Mouse and TC 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
13 
Mar. 18, 2010 
Mouse™ from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N. J. ), and the 
Velocimmune mouse from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. (Tarrytown, N. Y. ). 
[0133] In an alternative, antibodies may be made recombi- 
nantly and expressed using any method known in the art. In 
another alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly 
by phage display technology. See, for example, U. S. Pat. Nos. 
5, 66, , 322; 5, 800, 177; 5, 733, 743; and 6, 265, 150; and Winter 
et al. , 1994, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-455. Alternatively, 
the phage display technology (McCafferty et al. , 1990, 
Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibod- 
ies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin 
variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized 
donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain 
genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat 
protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or 
fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the 
surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle 
contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, 
selections based on the functional properties of the antibody 
also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody 
exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of 
the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in 
a variety of formats; see, e. g. , Johnson, Kevin S, and 
Chiswell, David J. , 1993, Current Opinion in Structural Biol- 
ogy 3:564-571. Several sources of V-gene segments can be 
used for phage display. Clackson et al. , 1991, Nature 352: 
624-628 isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies 
from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived 
from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes 
from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and 
antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-anti- 
gens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques 
described by Mark et al. , 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597, or 
Griffith et al. , 1993, EMBO J. 12:725-734. In a natural 
immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a 
high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes 
introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying 
high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially rep- 
licated and differentiated during subsequent antigen chal- 
lenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing 
the technique known as "chain shuflIing. " (Marks et al. , 1992, 
Bio/Technol. 10:779-783). In this method, the affinity of "pri- 
mary" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be 
improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain 
V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring vari- 
ants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmu- 
nized donors. This technique allows the production of anti- 
bodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the pM-nM 
range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody rep- 
ertoires (also known as "the mother-of all libraries" ) has been 
described by Waterhouse et al. , 1993, Nucl. Acids Res. 
21:2265-2266. Gene shuffling can also be used to derive 
human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human 
antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting 
rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also 
referred to as "epitope imprinting", the heavy or light chain V 
domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display 
technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain 
genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen 
results in isolation of human variable regions capable of 
restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i. e. , the epitope 
governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is 
repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a 
human antibody is obtained (see PCT Publ. No. WO 
93/06213). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent anti- 
bodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely 
human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR resi- 
dues of rodent origin. 
[0134] It is apparent that although the above discussion 
pertains to humanized antibodies, the general principles dis- 
cussed are applicable to customizing antibodies for use, for 
example, in dogs, cats, primate, equines and bovines. It is 
further apparent that one or more aspects of humanizing an 
antibody described herein may be combined, e. g. , CDR graft- 
ing, framework mutation and CDR mutation. 
[0135] Antibodies may be made recombinantly by first iso- 
lating the antibodies and antibody producing cells from host 
animals, obtaining the gene sequence, and using the gene 
sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in host cells 
(e. g. , CHO cells). Another method which may be employed is 
to express the antibody sequence in plants (e. g. , tobacco) or 
transgenic milk. Methods for expressing antibodies recombi- 
nantly in plants or milk have been disclosed. See, for 
example, Peeters, 2001, et al. Vaccine 19:2756; Lonberg, N. 
and D. Huszar, 1995, Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65; and Pollock, 
et al. , 1999, J Immunol Methods 231:147. Methods for mak- 
ing derivatives of antibodies, e. g. , humanized, single chain, 
etc. are known in the art. 
[0136] Immunoassays and flow cytometry sorting tech- 
niques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) can 
also be employed to isolate antibodies that are specific for 
PCSK9. 
[0137] The antibodies can be bound to many different car- 
riers. Carriers can be active and/or inert. Examples of well- 
known carriers include polypropylene, polystyrene, polyeth- 
ylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, glass, natural and modified 
celluloses, polyacrylamides, agaroses and magnetite. The 
nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for 
purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of 
other suitable carriers for binding antibodies, or will be able 
to ascertain such, using routine experimentation. In some 
embodiments, the carrier comprises a moiety that targets the 
myocardium. 
[0138] DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily 
isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e. g. , 
by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding 
specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of 
the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a 
preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may 
be placed into expression vectors (such as expression vectors 
disclosed in PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462), which are then 
transfected into host cells such as E. co/i cells, simian COS 
cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells 
that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to 
obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recom- 
binant host cells. See, e. g. , PCT Publ. No. WO 87/04462. The 
DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the 
coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant 
domains in place of the homologous murine sequences, Mor- 
rison et al. , 1984, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81:6851, or by 
covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence 
all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin 
polypeptide. In that manner, "chimeric" or "hybrid" antibod- 
ies are prepared that have the binding specificity of a PCSK9 
monoclonal antibody herein. 
[0139] PCSK9 antagonist antibodies and polypeptides 
derived from antibodies can be identified or characterized 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
14 
Mar. 18, 2010 
using methods known in the art, whereby reduction, amelio- 
ration, or neutralization of PCSK9 biological activity is 
detected and/or measured. In some embodiments, a PCSK9 
antagonist antibody or polypeptide is identified by incubating 
a candidate agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and/or 
attendant reduction or neutralization of a biological activity 
of PCSK9. The binding assay may be performed with purified 
PCSK9 polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or 
trans fected to express, PCSK9 polypeptide(s). In one 
embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding 
assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete 
with a known PCSK9 antagonist for PCSK9 binding is evalu- 
ated. The assay may be performed in various formats, includ- 
ing the ELISA format. In other embodiments, a PCSK9 
antagonist antibody is identified by incubating a candidate 
agent with PCSK9 and monitoring binding and attendant 
inhibition of LDLR expression and/or blood cholesterol 
clearance. 
[0140] Following initial identification, the activity of a can- 
didate PCSK9 antagonist antibody can be further confirmed 
and refined by bioassays that are known to test the targeted 
biological activities. Alternatively, bioassays can be used to 
screen candidates directly. Some of the methods for identi fy- 
ing and characterizing PCSK9 antagonist antibodies, pep- 
tides, or aptamers are described in detail in the Examples. 
[0141] PCSK9 antagonist antibodies may be characterized 
using methods well known in the art. For example, one 
method is to identify the epitope to which it binds, or "epitope 
mapping. 
" There are many methods known in the art for 
mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on pro- 
teins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody- 
antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expres- 
sion assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, 
for example, in Chapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Anti- 
bodies, a Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Labora- 
tory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y. , 1999). In an additional 
example, epitope mapping can be used to determine the 
sequence to which a PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds. 
Epitope mapping is commercially available from various 
sources, for example, Pepscan Systems (Edelhertweg 15, 
8219 PH Lelystad, The Netherlands). The epitope can be a 
linear epitope, i. e. , contained in a single stretch of amino 
acids, or a conformational epitope formed by a three-dimen- 
sional interaction of amino acids that may not necessarily be 
contained in a single stretch. Peptides of varying lengths (e g. , 
at least 4-6 amino acids long) can be isolated or synthesized 
(e. g. , recombinantly) and used for binding assays with a 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody. In another example, the epitope 
to which the PCSK9 antagonist antibody binds can be deter- 
mined in a systematic screening by using overlapping pep- 
tides derived from the PCSK9 sequence and determining 
binding by the PCSK9 antagonist antibody. According to the 
gene fragment expression assays, the open reading frame 
encoding PCSK9 is fragmented either randomly or by spe- 
cific genetic constructions and the reactivity of the expressed 
fragments of PCSK9 with the antibody to be tested is deter- 
mined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by 
PCR and then transcribed and translated into protein in vitro, 
in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The binding of the 
antibody to the radioactively labeled PCSK9 fragments is 
then determined by immunoprecipitation and gel electro- 
phoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by using 
large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the 
surface of phage particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a 
defined library of overlapping peptide fragments can be tested 
for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. In an 
additional example, mutagenesis of an antigen binding 
domain, domain swapping experiments and alanine scanning 
mutagenesis can be performed to identify residues required, 
sufficient, and/or necessary for epitope binding. For example, 
domain swapping experiments can be performed using a 
mutant PCSK9 in which various fragments of the PCSK9 
polypeptide have been replaced (swapped) with sequences 
from PCSK9 from another species, or a closely related, but 
antigenically distinct protein (such as another member of the 
proprotein convertase family). By assessing binding of the 
antibody to the mutant PCS K9, the importance of the particu- 
lar PCSK9 fragment to antibody binding can be assessed. 
[0142] Yet another method which can be used to character- 
ize a PCSK9 antagonist antibody is to use competition assays 
with other antibodies known to bind to the same antigen, i. e. , 
various fragments on PCSK9, to determine if the PCSK9 
antagonist antibody binds to the same epitope as other anti- 
bodies. Competition assays are well known to those of skill in 
the art. 
[0143] The crystal structure of the antibody and antibody: 
antigen complex can also be used to characterize the anti- 
body. The residues are identified by calculating the difference 
in accessible surface area between the LIL3:PCSK9 crystal 
structure and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that 
show buried surface area upon complex formation with L I L3 
antibody are included as a part of the epitope. The solvent 
accessible surface of a protein is defined as the locus of the 
centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 
1. 4 A. radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the 
protein. The solvent accessible surface area is calculated by 
generating surface points on an extended sphere about each 
atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of 
the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie 
within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms 
as implemented in program AREAIMOL (Briggs, P. J. , 2000,

[0144] An expression vector can be used to direct expres- 
sion of a PCSK9 antagonist antibody. One skilled in the art is 
familiar with administration of expression vectors to obtain 
expression of an exogenous protein in vivo. See, e. g. , U. S. 
Pat. Nos. 6, 436, 908; 6, 413, 942; and 6, 376, 471. Administra- 
tion of expression vectors includes local or systemic admin- 
istration, including injection, oral administration, particle 
gun or catheterized administration, and topical administra- 
tion. In another embodiment, the expression vector is admin- 
istered directly to the sympathetic trunk or ganglion, or into a 
coronary artery, atrium, ventrical, or pericardium. 
[0145] Targeted delivery of therapeutic compositions con- 
taining an expression vector, or subgenomic polynucleotides 
can also be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery tech- 
niques are described in, for example, Findeis et al. , 1993, 
Trends Biotechnol. 11:202; Chiou et al. , 1994, Gene Thera- 
peutics: Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer 
(J. A. Wol ff, ed. ); Wu et al. , 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263:621; Wu 
et al. , 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:542; Zenke et al. , 1990, Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:3655; Wu et al. , 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 
266:338. Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucle- 
otide are administered in a range of about 100 ng to about 200 
mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy proto- 
col. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, 
about I pg to about 2 mg, about 5 pg to about 500 pg, and 
about 20 pg to about 100 pg of DNA can also be used during

a gene therapy protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides and 
polypeptides can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. 
The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin 
(see generally, Jolly, 1994, Cancer Gene Therapy 1:51; 
Kimura, 1994, Human Gene Therapy 5:845; Connelly, 1995, 
Human Gene Therapy 1:185; and Kaplitt, 1994, Nature 
Genetics 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences can be 
induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous pro- 
moters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either 
constitutive or regulated. 
[0146] Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired poly- 
nucleotide and expression in a desired cell are well known in 
the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not 
limited to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e. g. , PCT Publ. 
Nos. WO 90/07936; WO 94/03622; WO 93/25698; WO 
93/25234; WO 93/11230; WO 93/10218; WO 91/02805; U. S. 
Pat. Nos. 5, 219, 740 and 4, 777, 127; GB Patent No. 2, 200, 651; 
and EP Patent No. 0 345 242), alphavirus-based vectors (e. g. , 
Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR-67; 
ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC 
VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC 
VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532)), 
and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (see, e. g. , PCT 
Publ. Nos. WO 94/12649, WO 93/03769; WO 93/19191; WO 
94/28938; WO 95/11984 and WO 95/00655). Administration 
of DNA linked to killed adenovirus as described in Curiel, 
1992, Hum. Gene Ther. 3:147, can also be employed. 
[0147] Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be 
employed, including, but not limited to, polycationic con- 
densed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone 
(see, e. g. , Curiel, 1992, Hum. Gene Ther. 3:147); ligand- 
linked DNA (see, e. g. , Wu, J. , 1989, Biol. Chem. 264: 16985); 
eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells (see, e. g. , U. S. Pat. No. 
5, 814, 482; PCT Publ. Nos. WO 95/07994; WO 96/17072; 
WO 95/30763; and WO 97/42338) and nucleic charge neu- 
tralization or fusion with cell membranes. Naked DNA can 
also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction meth- 
ods are described in PCT Publ. No. WO 90/11092 and U. S. 
Pat. No. 5, 800, 899. Liposomes that can act as gene delivery 
vehicles are described in U. S. Pat. No. 5, 422, 120; PCT Publ. 
Nos. WO 95/13796; WO 94/23697; WO 91/14445; and EP 
0524968. Additional approaches are described in Philip, 
1994, Mol. Cell. Biol. , 14:2411, and in Wo ffendin, 1994 Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. 91:1581. 
[0148] This invention encompasses compositions, includ- 
ing pharmaceutical compositions, comprising antibodies 
described herein or made by the methods and having the 
characteristics described herein. As used herein, composi- 
tions comprise one or more antibodies, peptides, or aptamers 
that antagonize the interaction of PCSK9 with the LDLR, 
and/or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences 
encoding one or more these antibodies or peptides. These 
compositions may further comprise suitable excipients, such 
as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, 
which are well known in the art. 
[0149] The PCSK9 antagonist antibodies and peptides of 
the invention are characterized by any (one or more) of the 
following characteristics: (a) bind to PCSK9; (b) block 
PCSK9 interaction with the LDLR; (c) decrease PCSK9- 
mediated down-regulation of the LDLR; and (d) inhibit 
PCSK9-mediated inhibition of LDL blood clearance. Prefer- 
ably, PCSK9 antibodies have two or more of these features. 
More preferably, the antibodies have three or more of the 
features. Most preferably, the antibodies have all four char- 
acteristics. 
[0150] Accordingly, the invention provides any of the fol- 
lowing, or compositions (including pharmaceutical compo- 
sitions) comprising any antibody having a partial light chain 
sequence and a partial heavy chain sequence as found in Table 
1. The underlined sequences are CDR sequences according to 
Kabat and in bold according to Chothia.

[0151] The invention also provides CDR portions of anti- 
bodies to PCSK9 (including Chothia and Kabat CDRs). 
Determination of CDR regions is well within the skill of the 
art. It is understood that in some embodiments, CDRs can be 
a combination of the Kabat and Chothia CDR (also termed 
"combined CDRs" or "extended CDRs"). In some embodi- 
ments, the CDRs are the Kabat CDRs. In other embodiments, 
the CDRs are the Chothia CDRs. In other words, in embodi- 
ments with more than one CDR, the CDRs may be any of 
Kabat, Chothia, combination CDRs, or combinations thereof. 
[0152] The invention also provides methods of making any 
of these antibodies or polypeptides. The antibodies of this 
invention can be made by procedures known in the art. The 
polypeptides can be produced by proteolytic or other degra- 
dation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods (ke. , single 
or fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical 
synthesis. Polypeptides of the antibodies, especially shorter 
polypeptides up to about 50 amino acids, are conveniently 
made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical synthesis 
are known in the art and are commercially available. For 
example, an antibody could be produced by an automated 
polypeptide synthesizer employing the solid phase method. 
See also, U. S. Pat. Nos. 5, 807, 715; 4, 816, 567; and 6, 331, 415. 
[0153] In another alternative, the antibodies and peptides 
can be made recombinantly using procedures that are well 
known in the art. In one embodiment, a polynucleotide com- 
prises a sequence encoding the heavy chain and/or the light 
chain variable regions of antibody 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, 7D4 or 
L I L3. The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may be 
maintained in a vector in a host cell and the host cell can then 
be expanded and frozen for future use. Vectors (including 
expression vectors) and host cells are further described 
herein. 
[0154] The invention also encompasses scFv of antibodies 
of this invention. Single chain variable region fragments are 
made by linking light and/or heavy chain variable regions by 
using a short linking peptide. Bird et al. , 1988, Science 242: 
423-426. An example of a linking peptide is (GGGGS)3 (SEQ 
ID NO:24), which bridges approximately 3. 5 nm between the 
carboxy terminus of one variable region and the amino ter- 
minus of the other variable region. Linkers of other sequences 
have been designed and used. Bird et al. , 1988, supra. Linkers 
should be short, flexible polypeptides and preferably com- 
prised of less than about 20 amino acid residues. Linkers can 
in turn be modified for additional functions, such as attach- 
ment of drugs or attachment to solid supports. The single 
chain variants can be produced either recombinantly or syn- 
thetically. For synthetic production of scFv, an automated 
synthesizer can be used. For recombinant production of scFv, 
a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes the 
scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukary- 
otic, such as yeast, plant, insect or mammalian cells, or 
prokaryotic, such as E. co/i. Polynucleotides encoding the 
scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as 
ligationofpolynucleotides. TheresultantscFvcanbeisolated 
using standard protein purification techniques known in the 
art. 
[0155] Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as dia- 
bodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispe- 
cific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed 
on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too 
short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the 
same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with comple- 
mentary domains of another chain and creating two antigen 
binding sites (see e. g. , Holliger, P. , et al. , 1993, Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J. , et al. , 1994, 
Structure 2: 1121-1123). 
US 2010/0068199 A1

[0156] For example, bispecific antibodies, monoclonal 
antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two 
different antigens, can be prepared using the antibodies dis- 
closed herein. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are 
known in the art (see, e. g. , Suresh et al. , 1986, Methods in 
Enzymology 121:210). Traditionally, the recombinant pro- 
duction of bispecific antibodies was based on the coexpres- 
sion of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, 
with the two heavy chains having different specificities (Mill- 
stein and Cuello, 1983, Nature 305, 537-539). 
[0157] According to one approach to making bispecific 
antibodies, antibody variable domains with the desired bind- 
ing specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused 
to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion 
preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant 
domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 
regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant 
region (CHI), containing the site necessary for light chain 
binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding 
the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the 
immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate 
expression vectors, and are cotrans fected into a suitable host 
organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the 
mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in 
embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide 
chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It 
is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or 
all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the 
expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios 
results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular 
significance. 
[0158] In one approach, the bispecific antibodies are com- 
posed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first 
binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin 
heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding 
specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure, with 
an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispe- 
cific molecule, facilitates the separation of the desired bispe- 
cific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain com- 
binations. This approach is described in PCT Publ. No. WO 
94/04690. 
[0159] Heteroconjugate antibodies, comprising two 
covalently joined antibodies, are also within the scope of the 
invention. Such antibodies have been used to target immune 
system cells to unwanted cells (U. S. Pat. No. 4, 676, 980), and 
for treatment of HI V infection (PCT Publ. No s. WO 91/00360 
and WO 92/200373; EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies 
may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. 
Suitable cross-linking agents and techniques are well known 
in the art, and are described in U. S. Pat. No. 4, 676, 980. 
[0160] Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared 
in vitro using known methods of synthetic protein chemistry, 
including those involving cross-linking agents. For example, 
immunotoxins may be constructed using a di sulfid exchange 
reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable 
reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl- 
4-merc aptobutyrimi date. 
[0161] Humanized antibody comprising one or more CDRs 
of antibodies 5AI 0 or 7D4 or one or more CDRs derived from 
antibodies 5AI0 or 7D4 can be made, for example, using any 
methods know in the art. For example, four general steps may 
be used to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (I) 
determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid 
sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable 
domains; (2) designing the humanized antibody, i. e. , deciding 
which antibody framework region to use during the human- 
izing process; (3) using the actual humanizing methodolo- 
gies/techniques; and (4) transfecting and expressing the 
humanized antibody. See, for example, U. S. Pat. Nos. 4, 816, 
567; 5, 807, 715; 5, 866, 692; 6, 331, 415; 5, 300, 011; 5, 693, 761; 
5, 693, 762; 5, 88, , 899; and 6, 180, 370. 
[0162] In the recombinant humanized antibodies, the Fc 
portion can be modified to avoid interaction with F c7 receptor 
and the complement and immune systems. The techniques for 
preparation of such antibodies are described in WO 
99/58572. For example, the constant region may be engi- 
neered to more resemble human constant regions to avoid 
immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and 
treatments in humans. See, for example, U. S. Pat. Nos. 5, 997, 
867 and 5, 866, 692. 
[0163] Humanized antibody comprising the light or heavy 
chain variable regions or one or more CDRs of an antibody or 
its variants shown in Table I, or one or more CDRs derived 
from the antibody or its variants shown in Table 2 can be made 
using any methods known in the art. 
[0164] Humanized antibodies may be made by any method 
known in the art. 
[0165] The invention encompasses modifications to the 
antibodies and polypeptides of the invention variants shown 
in Table I, including functionally equivalent antibodies 
which do not significantly affect their properties and variants 
which have enhanced or decreased activity and/or affinity. For 
example, the amino acid sequence may be mutated to obtain 
an antibody with the desired binding affinity to PCSK9. 
Modification of polypeptides is routine practice in the art and 
need not be described in detail herein. Modification of 
polypeptides is exemplified in the Examples. Examples of 
modified polypeptides include polypeptides with conserva- 
tive substitutions of amino acid residues, one or more dele- 
tions or additions of amino acids which do not significantly 
deleteriously change the functional activity, or which mature 
(enhance) the affinity of the polypeptide for its ligand, or use 
of chemical analogs. 
[0166] Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- 
and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one 
residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more resi- 
dues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple 
amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include 
an antibody with an ¹erminal methionyl residue or the 
antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of 
the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-ter- 
minus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which 
increases the half-life of the antibody in the blood circulation. 
[0167] Substitution variants have at least one amino acid 
residue in the antibody molecule removed and a different 
residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for 
substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, 
but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative sub- 
stitutions are shown in Table 2 under the heading of "conser- 
vative substitutions. " If such substitutions result in a change 
in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denomi- 
nated "exemplary substitutions" in Table 2, or as further 
described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be 
introduced and the products screened.

[0168] Substantial modifications in the biological proper- 
ties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitu- 
tions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) 
the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the 
substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, 
(b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target 
site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring 
residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain 
properties: 
[0169] (I) Non-polar: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, 
Ile; 
[0170] (2) Polar without charge: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln; 
[0171] (3) Acidic (negatively charged): Asp, Glu; 
[0172] (4) Basic (positively charged): Lys, Arg; 
[0173] (5) Residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, 
Pro; and 
[0174] (6) Aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe, His. 
[0175] Non-conservative substitutions are made by 
exchanging a member of one of these classes for another 
class. 
[0176] Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining 
the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substi- 
tuted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability 
of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross-linking. Con- 
versely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to 
improve its stability, particularly where the antibody is an 
antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment. 
[0177] Amino acid modifications can range from changing 
or modifying one or more amino acids to complete redesign 
of a region, such as the variable region. Changes in the vari- 
able region can alter binding affinity and/or specificity. In 
some embodiments, no more than one to five conservative 
amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In 
other embodiments, no more than one to three conservative 
amino acid substitutions are made within a CDR domain. In 
still other embodiments, the CDR domain is CDR H3 and/or 
CDR L3. 
[0178] Modifications also include glycosylated and nong- 
lycosylated polypeptides, as well as polypeptides with other 
post-translational modifications, such as, for example, glyco- 
sylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphoryla- 
tion. Antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in 
their constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, 1997, Chem. Immu- 
nol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, 1997, TibTECH 
15:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immuno- 
globulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et al. , 1996, Mol. 
Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Bio- 
chem. 29:4175-4180) and the intramolecular interaction 
between portions of the glycoprotein, which can affect the 
conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the 
glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 
1996, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides 
may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain mol- 
ecules based upon specific recognition structures. Glycosy- 
lation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody- 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO 
cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of [3(1, 4) N- 
acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltrans- 
ferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was 
reported to have improved ADCC activity (Umana et al. , 
1999, Nature Biotech. 17:176-180). 
[0179] Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either 
N-linked or 0-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the 
carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine resi- 
due. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine, aspar- 
agine-X-threonine, and asparagine-X-cysteine, where X is 
any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences 
for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the 
asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these 
tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential gly- 
cosylation site. 0-linked glycosylation refers to the attach- 
ment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, 
or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or 
threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine 
may also be used. 
[0180] Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is 
conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid 
sequence such that it contains one or more of the above- 
described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation 
sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or 
substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the 
sequence of the original antibody (for 0-linked glycosylation 
sites). 
[0181] The glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be 
altered without altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. 
Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express 
the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression o f recom- 
binant glycoproteins, e. g. , antibodies, as potential therapeu- 
tics is rarely the native cell, variations in the glycosylation 
pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e. g. , Hse et al. , 
1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070). 
[0182] In addition to the choice of host cells, factors that 
affect glycosylation during recombinant production of anti- 
bodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture den- 
sity, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Vari- 
ous methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation 
pattern achieved in a particular host organism including intro- 
ducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oli- 
gosaccharide production (U. S. Pat. Nos. 5, 047, 335; 5, 510, 
261 and 5, 278, 299). Glycosylation, or certain types of 
glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the gly- 
coprotein, for example, using endoglycosidase H (Endo H), 
N-glycosidase F, endoglycosidase Fl, endoglycosidase F2, 
endoglycosidase F3. In addition, the recombinant host cell 
US 2010/0068199 A1

can be genetically engineered to be defective in processing 
certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar tech- 
niques are well known in the art. 
[0183] Other methods of modification include using cou- 
pling techniques known in the art, including, but not limited 
to, enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation. 
Modifications can be used, for example, for attachment of 
labels for immunoassay. Modified polypeptides are made 
using established procedures in the art and can be screened 
using standard assays known in the art, some of which are 
described below and in the Examples. 
[0184] In some embodiments of the invention, the antibody 
comprises a modified constant region, such as a constant 
region that is immunologically inert or partially inert, e. g. , 
does not trigger complement mediated lysis, does not stimu- 
late ADCC, or does not activate microglia; or have reduced 
activities (compared to the unmodified antibody) in any one 
or more of the following: triggering complement mediated 
lysis, stimulating ADCC, or activating microglia. Different 
modifications of the constant region may be used to achieve 
optimal level and/or combination of effector functions. See, 
for example, Morgan et al. , 1995, Immunology 86:319-324; 
Lund et al. , 1996, J. Immunology 157:4963-9 157:4963- 
4969; Idusogie et al. , 2000, J. Immunology 164:4178-4184; 
Tao et al. , 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595-2601; and Jefferis 
et al. , 1998, Immunological Reviews 163:59-76. In some 
embodiments, the constant region is modified as described in 
Eur. J. Immunol. , 1999, 29:2613-2624; PCT Publ. No. 
WO99/58572; and/or UK Patent Application No. 9809951. 8. 
In other embodiments, the antibody comprises a human 
heavy chain IgG2 constant region comprising the following 
mutations: A330P331 to S330S331 (amino acid numbering 
with reference to the wild type IgG2 sequence). Eur. J. Immu- 
nol. , 1999, 29:2613-2624. In still other embodiments, the 
constant region is aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation. 
In some embodiments, the constant region is aglycosylated 
for N-linked glycosylation by mutating the glycosylated 
amino acid residue or flanking residues that are part of the 
N-glycosylation recognition sequence in the constant region. 
For example, N-glycosylation site N297 may be mutated to A, 
Q, K, or H. See, Tao et al. , 1989, J. Immunology 143: 2595- 
2601; and Jefferis et al. , 1998, Immunological Reviews 163: 
59-76. In some embodiments, the constant region is aglyco- 
sylated for N-linked glycosylation. The constant region may 
be aglycosylated for N-linked glycosylation enzymatically 
(such as removing carbohydrate by enzyme PNGase), or by 
expression in a glycosylation deficient host cell. 
[0185] Other antibody modifications include antibodies 
that have been modified as described in PCT Publ. No. WO 
99/58572. These antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding 
domain directed at the target molecule, an effector domain 
having an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to 
all or part of a constant domain of a human immunoglobulin 
heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the 
target molecule without triggering significant complement 
dependent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of the target. In 
some embodiments, the effector domain is capable of specifi- 
cally binding FcRn and/or Fc7RIIb. These are typically based 
on chimeric domains derived from two or more human immu- 
noglobulin heavy chain C~2 domains. Antibodies modified in 
this manner are particularly suitable for use in chronic anti- 
body therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reac- 
tions to conventional antibody therapy. 
[0186] The invention includes affinity matured embodi- 
ments. For example, affinity matured antibodies can be pro- 
duced by procedures known in the art (Marks et al. , 1992, 
Bio/Technology, 10:779-783; Barbas et al. , 1994, Proc Nat. 
Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813; Schier et al. , 1995, Gene, 
169:147-155; Yelton et al. , 1995, J. Immunol. , 155:1994- 
2004; Jackson et al. , 1995, J. Immunol. , 154(7):3310-9; 
Hawkins et al. , 1992, J. Mol. Biol. , 226:889-896; and PCT 
Publ. No. WO2004/058184). 
[0187] The following methods may be used for adjusting 
the affinity of an antibody and for characterizing a CDR. One 
way of characterizing a CDR of an antibody and/or altering 
(such as improving) the binding affinity of a polypeptide, 
such as an antibody, termed "library scanning mutagenesis". 
Generally, library scanning mutagenesis works as follows. 
One or more amino acid positions in the CDR are replaced 
with two or more (such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20) amino acids using art recognized 
methods. This generates small libraries of clones (in some 
embodiments, one for every amino acid position that is ana- 
lyzed), each with a complexity of two or more members (if 
two or more amino acids are substituted at every position). 
Generally, the library also includes a clone comprising the 
native (unsub stituted) amino acid. A small number of clones, 
e. g. , about 20-80 clones (depending on the complexity of the 
library), from each library are screened for binding affinity to 
the target polypeptide (or other binding target), and candi- 
dates with increased, the same, decreased, or no binding are 
identified. Methods for determining binding affinity are well- 
known in the art. Binding affinity may be determined using 
Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis, which detects 
differences in binding affinity of about 2-fold or greater. 
Biacore is particularly useful when the starting antibody 
already binds with a relatively high affinity, for example a K~ 
of about 10 nM or lower. Screening using Biacore surface 
plasmon resonance is described in the Examples, herein. 
[01SS] Binding affinity may be determined using Kinexa 
Biocensor, scintillation proximity assays, ELISA, ORIGEN 
immunoassay (IGEN), fluorescence quenching, fluorescence 
transfer, and/or yeast display. Binding affinity may also be 
screened using a suitable bioassay. 
[0189] In some embodiments, every amino acid position in 
a CDR is replaced (in some embodiments, one at a time) with 
all 20 natural amino acids using art recognized mutagenesis 
methods (some of which are described herein). This generates 
small libraries of clones (in some embodiments, one for every 
amino acid position that is analyzed), each with a complexity 
of 20 members (if all 20 amino acids are substituted at every 
position). 
[0190] In some embodiments, the library to be screened 
comprises substitutions in two or more positions, which may 
be in the same CDR or in two or more CDRs. Thus, the library 
may comprise substitutions in two or more positions in one 
CDR. The library may comprise substitution in two or more 
positions in two or more CDRs. The library may comprise 
substitution in 3, 4, 5, or more positions, said positions found 
in two, three, four, five or six CDRs. The substitution may be 
prepared using low redundancy codons. See, e. g. , Table 2 of 
Balint et al. , 1993, Gene 137(1):109-18). 
[0191] The CDR may be CDRH3 and/or CDRL3. The CDR 
may be one or more of CDRLI, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRHI, 
CDRH2, and/or CDRH3. The CDR may be a Kabat CDR, a 
Chothia CDR, or an extended CDR.

Mar. 18, 2010 
[0192] Candidates with improved binding may be 
sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution mutant 
which results in improved affinity (also termed an 
"improved" substitution). Candidates that bind may also be 
sequenced, thereby identifying a CDR substitution which 
retains binding. 
[0193] Multiple rounds o f screening may be conducted. For 
example, candidates (each comprising an amino acid substi- 
tution at one or more position of one or more CDR) with 
improved binding are also useful for the design of a second 
library containing at least the original and substituted amino 
acid at each improved CDR position (he. , amino acid position 
in the CDR at which a substitution mutant showed improved 
binding). Preparation, screening, and selection of this library 
is discussed further below. 
[0194] Library scanning mutagenesis also provides a 
means for characterizing a CDR, in so far as the frequency of 
clones with improved binding, the same binding, decreased 
binding or no binding also provide information relating to the 
importance of each amino acid position for the stability of the 
antibody-antigen complex. For example, if a position of the 
CDR retains binding when changed to a1120 amino acids, that 
position is identified as a position that is unlikely to be 
required for antigen binding. Conversely, if a position o f CDR 
retains binding in only a small percentage of substitutions, 
that position is identified as a position that is important to 
CDR function. Thus, the library scanning mutagenesis meth- 
ods generate information regarding positions in the CDRs 
that can be changed to many different amino acids (including 
all 20 amino acids), and positions in the CDRs which cannot 
be changed or which can only be changed to a few amino 
acids. 
[0195] Candidates with improved affinity may be com- 
bined in a second library, which includes the improved amino 
acid, the original amino acid, and may further include addi- 
tional substitutions at that position, depending on the com- 
plexity of the library that is desired, or permitted using the 
desired screening or selection method. In addition, if desired, 
and adjacent amino acid position can be randomized to at 
least two or more amino acids. Randomization of adjacent 
amino acids may permit additional conformational flexibility 
in the mutant CDR, which may, in turn, permit or facilitate the 
introduction of a larger number of improving mutations. The 
library may also comprise substitution at positions that did 
not show improved affinity in the first round of screening. 
[0196] The second library is screened or selected for library 
members with improved and/or altered binding affinity using 
any method known in the art, including screening using Bia- 
core surface plasmon resonance analysis, and selection using 
any method known in the art for selection, including phage 
display, yeast display, and ribosome display. 
[0197] The invention also encompasses fusion proteins 
comprising one or more fragments or regions from the anti- 
bodies or polypeptides of this invention. In one embodiment, 
a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10 
contiguous amino acids of a variable light chain region shown 
in SEQ ID NOs: 53, 16, 17, 18, or 19 and/or at least 10 amino 
acids of a variable heavy chain region shown in SEQ ID NOs: 
54, 20, 21, 22, or 23. In other embodiments, a fusion polypep- 
tide is provided that comprises at least about 10, at least about 
15, at least about 20, at least about 25, or at least about 30 
contiguous amino acids of the variable light chain region 
and/or at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at 
least about 25, or at least about 30 contiguous amino acids of 
the variable heavy chain region. In another embodiment, the 
fusion polypeptide comprises a light chain variable region 
and/or a heavy chain variable region, as shown in any of the 
sequence pairs selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 53 and 54, 
16 and 20, 17 and 21, 18 and 22, and 19 and 23. In another 
embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises one or more 
CDR(s). In still other embodiments, the fusion polypeptide 
comprises CDR H3 (VH CDR3) and/or CDR L3 (VL CDR3). 
For purposes of this invention, a fusion protein contains one 
or more antibodies and another amino acid sequence to which 
it is not attached in the native molecule, for example, a het- 
erologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another 
region. Exemplary heterologous sequences include, but are 
not limited to a "tag" such as a FLAG tag or a 6H is tag. Tags 
are well known in the art. 
[0198] A fusion polypeptide can be created by methods 
known in the art, for example, synthetically or recombinantly. 
Typically, the fusion proteins of this invention are made by 
preparing an expressing a polynucleotide encoding them 
using recombinant methods described herein, although they 
may also be prepared by other means known in the art, includ- 
ing, for example, chemical synthesis. 
[0199] This invention also provides compositions compris- 
ing antibodies or polypeptides conjugated (for example, 
linked) to an agent that facilitate coupling to a solid support 
(such as biotin or avidin). For simplicity, reference will be 
made generally to antibodies with the understanding that 
these methods apply to any of the PCSK9 binding and/or 
antagonist embodiments described herein. Conjugation gen- 
erally refers to linking these components as described herein. 
The linking (which is generally fixing these components in 
proximate association at least for administration) can be 
achieved in any number of ways. For example, a direct reac- 
tion between an agent and an antibody is possible when each 
possesses a substituent capable of reacting with the other. For 
example, a nucleophilic group, such as an amino or sulfhydryl 
group, on one may be capable of reacting with a carbonyl- 
containing group, such as an anhydride or an acid halide, or 
with an alkyl group containing a good leaving group (e. g. , a 
halide) on the other. 
[0200] An antibody or polypeptide of this invention may be 
linked to a labeling agent such as a fluorescent molecule, a 
radioactive molecule or any others labels known in the art. 
Labels are known in the art which generally provide (either 
directly or indirectly) a signal. 
[0201] The invention also provides compositions (includ- 
ing pharmaceutical compositions) and kits comprising, as 
this disclosure makes clear, any or all of the antibodies and/or 
polypeptides described herein. 
[0202] The invention also provides isolated polynucle- 
otides encoding the antibodies and peptides of the invention, 
and vectors and host cells comprising the polynucleotide. 
[0203] Accordingly, the invention provides polynucle- 
otides (or compositions, including pharmaceutical composi- 
tions), comprising polynucleotides encoding any of the fol- 
lowing: the antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, 7D4, LIL3, or any 
fragment or part thereof having the ability to antagonize 
PCSK9. 
[0204] In another aspect, the invention provides polynucle- 
otides encoding any of the antibodies (including antibody 
fragments) and polypeptides described herein, such as anti- 
bodies and polypeptides having impaired effector function. 
Polynucleotides can be made and expressed by procedures 
known in the art. 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
21 
Mar. 18, 2010 
[0205] In another aspect, the invention provides composi- 
tions (such as pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any 
of the polynucleotides of the invention. In some embodi- 
ments, the composition comprises an expression vector com- 
prising a polynucleotide encoding the antibody as described 
herein. In other embodiment, the composition comprises an 
expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding any 
of the antibodies or polypeptides described herein. In still 
other embodiments, the composition comprises either or both 
of the polynucleotides shown in SEQ ID NO:25 and SEQ ID 
NO:26. Expression vectors, and administration ofpolynucle- 
otide compositions are further described herein. 
[0206] In another aspect, the invention provides a method 
of making any of the polynucleotides described herein. 
[0207] Polynucleotides complementary to any such 
sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. 
Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or anti sense) 
or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or 
synthetic) or RNA molecules. RNA molecules include 
HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and correspond to 
a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA mol- 
ecules, which do not contain introns. Additional coding or 
non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a 
polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide 
may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support 
materials. 
[0208] Polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence 
(i. e. , an endogenous sequence that encodes an antibody or a 
portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. 
Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, 
additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immu- 
noreactivity of the encoded polypeptide is not diminished, 
relative to a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on 
the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide may gen- 
erally be assessed as described herein. Variants preferably 
exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably, at least 
about 80% identity, yet more preferably, at least about 90% 
identity, and most preferably, at least about 95% identity to a 
polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native antibody or a 
portion thereof. 
[0209] Two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are 
said to be "identical" if the sequence of nucleotides or amino 
acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for 
maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons 
between two sequences are typically performed by compar- 
ing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and 
compare local regions of sequence similarity. A "comparison 
window" as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 
20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, or 40 to about 
50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference 
sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after 
the two sequences are optimally aligned. 
[0210] Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison 
may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Laser- 
gene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc. , 
Madison, Wis. ), using default parameters. This program 
embodies several alignment schemes described in the follow- 
ing references: Dayhoff, M. O. , 1978, A model of evolution- 
ary change in proteins Matrices for detecting distant rela- 
tionships. In Dayhoff, M. O. (ed. ) Atlas of Protein Sequence 
and Structure (National Biomedical Research Foundation, 
Washington D. C. ), Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-358; Hein J. , 
1990, Unified Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 
626-645 Methods in Enzymology vol. 183, (Academic Press, 
Inc. , San Diego, Calif. ); Higgins, D. G. and Sharp, P. M. , 
1989, CABIOS 5:151-153; Myers, E. W. and Muller W. , 
1988, CABIOS 4:11-17; Robinson, E. D. , 1971, Comb. 
Theor. 11:105; Santou, N. , Nes, M. , 1987, Mol. Biol. Evol. 
4:406-425; Sneath, P. H. A. and Sokal, R. R. , 1973, Numerical 
Taxonomy the Principles and Practice of Numerical Tax- 
onomy (Freeman Press, San Francisco, Calif. ); Wilbur, W. J. 
and Lipman, D. J. , 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:726- 
730. 
[0211] Preferably, the "percentage of sequence identity" is 
determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences 
over a window of comparison of at least 20 positions, wherein 
the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in 
the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions 
(i. e. , gaps) of 20 percent or less, usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10 
to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which 
does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal align- 
ment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by 
determining the number of positions at which the identical 
nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both 
sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing 
the number of matched positions by the total number of 
positions in the reference sequence (i. e. the window size) and 
multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of 
sequence identity. 
[0212] Variants may also, or alternatively, be substantially 
homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement 
thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybrid- 
izing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally 
occurring DNA sequence encoding a native antibody (or a 
complementary sequence). 
[0213] Suitable "moderately stringent conditions" include 
prewashing in a solution of SxSSC, 0. 5% SDS, 1. 0 mM 
EDTA (pH 8. 0); hybridizing at 50' C. -65' C. , SxSSC, over- 
night; followed by washing twice at 65' C. for 20 minutes 
with each of 2x, 0. 5x and 0. 2xSSC containing 0. 1% SDS. 
[0214] As used herein, "highly stringent conditions" or 
"high stringency conditions" are those that: (I) employ low 
ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 
0. 015 M sodium chloride/0. 0015 M sodium citrate/0. 1% 
sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50' C. ; (2) employ during hybrid- 
ization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 
50% (v/v) formamide with 0. 1% bovine serum albumin/0. 1' 
k Ficoll/0. 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phos- 
phate buffer at pH 6. 5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM 
sodium citrate at 42' C. ; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 
SxSSC (0. 75 M NaCI, 0. 075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM 
sodium phosphate (pH 6. 8), 0. 1% sodium pyrophosphate, 
SxDenhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 
pg/ml), 0. 1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42' C. , with 
washes at 42' C. in 0. 2xSSC (sodium chloride/sodium cit- 
rate) and 50% formamide at 55' C. , followed by a high- 
stringency wash consisting of 0. 1xSSC containing EDTA at 
55' C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the 
temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommo- 
date factors such as probe length and the like. 
[0215] It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the 
art that, as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, there 
are many nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide as 
described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear mini- 
mal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. 
Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in 
codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present 
invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the poly- 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
22 
Mar. 18, 2010 
nucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of 
the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are 
altered as a result of one or more mutations, such as deletions, 
additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting 
mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered struc- 
ture or function. Alleles may be identified using standard 
techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or data- 
base sequence comparison). 
[0216] The polynucleotides of this invention can be 
obtained using chemical synthesis, recombinant methods, or 
PCR. Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis are well 
known in the art and need not be described in detail herein. 
One of skill in the art can use the sequences provided herein 
and a commercial DNA synthesizer to produce a desired 
DNA sequence. 
[0217] For preparing polynucleotides using recombinant 
methods, a polynucleotide comprising a desired sequence can 
be inserted into a suitable vector, and the vector in turn can be 
introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and ampli- 
fication, as further discussed herein. Polynucleotides may be 
inserted into host cells by any means known in the art. Cells 
are trans formed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide 
by direct uptake, endocytosis, trans fection, F-mating or elec- 
troporation. Once introduced, the exogenous polynucleotide 
can be maintained within the cell as a non-integrated vector 
(such as a plasmid) or integrated into the host cell genome. 
The polynucleotide so amplified can be isolated from the host 
cell by methods well known within the art. See, e. g. , Sam- 
brook et al. , 1989, supra. 
[0218] Alternatively, PCR allows reproduction of DNA 
sequences. PCR technology is well known in the art and is 
described in U. S. Pat. Nos. 4, 683, 195, 4, 800, 159, 4, 754, 065 
and 4, 683, 202, as well as PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reac- 
tion, Mullis et al. , 1994, eds. (Birkauswer Press, Boston, 
Mass. ). 
[0219] RNA can be obtained by using the isolated DNA in 
an appropriate vector and inserting it into a suitable host cell. 
When the cell replicates and the DNA is transcribed into 
RNA, the RNA can then be isolated using methods well 
known to those of skill in the art, as set forth in Sambrook et 
al. , 1989, supra, for example. 
[0220] Suitable cloning vectors may be constructed accord- 
ing to standard techniques, or may be selected from a large 
number of cloning vectors available in the art. While the 
cloning vector selected may vary according to the host cell 
intended to be used, useful cloning vectors will generally 
have the ability to self-replicate, may possess a single target 
for a particular restriction endonuclease, and/or may carry 
genes for a marker that can be used in selecting clones con- 
taining the vector. Suitable examples include plasmids and 
bacterial viruses, e. g. , pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript (e. g. , pBS 
SK+) and its derivatives, mp 18, mp 19, pBR322, pMB9, 
ColEI, pCRI, RP4, phage DNAs, and shuttle vectors such as 
pSA3 and pAT28. These and many other cloning vectors are 
available from commercial vendors such as BioRad, Strate- 
gene, and Invitrogen. 
[0221] Expression vectors generally are replicable poly- 
nucleotide constructs that contain a polynucleotide according 
to the invention. It is implied that an expression vector must 
be replicable in the host cells either as episomes or as an 
integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression 
vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, 
including adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retrovi- 
ruses, cosmids, and expression vector(s) disclosed in PCT 
Publ. No. WO 87/04462. Vector components may generally 
include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: 
a signal sequence; an origin of replication; one or more 
marker genes; suitable transcriptional controlling elements 
(such as promoters, enhancers and terminator). For expres- 
sion (ke. , translation), one or more translational controlling 
elements are also usually required, such as ribosome binding 
sites, translation initiation sites, and stop codons. 
[0222] The vectors containing the polynucleotides of inter- 
est can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of 
appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection 
employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium 
phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojec- 
tile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e. g. , where the 
vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The 
choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often 
depend on features of the host cell. 
[0223] The invention also provides host cells comprising 
any of the polynucleotides described herein. Any host cells 
capable of over-expressing heterologous DNAs can be used 
for the purpose of isolating the genes encoding the antibody, 
polypeptide or protein of interest. Non-limiting examples of 
mammalian host cells include but are not limited to COS, 
HeLa, NSO, and CHO cells. See also PCT Publ. No. WO 
87/04462. Suitable non-mammalian host cells include 
prokaryotes (such as E. coli or B. subtillis) and yeast (such as 
S. cerevisae, S. pombe; or E. /actis). Preferably, the host cells 
express the cDNAs at a level of about 5 fold higher, more 
preferably, 10 fold higher, even more preferably, 20 fold 
higher than that of the corresponding endogenous antibody or 
protein of interest, if present, in the host cells. Screening the 
host cells for a specific binding to PCSK9 or a PCSK9 domain 
is effected by an immunoassay or FACS. A cell overexpress- 
ing the antibody or protein of interest can be identified. 
C. Compositions 
[0224] The compositions used in the methods of the inven- 
tion comprise an effective amount of a PCSK9 antagonist 
antibody, a PCSK9 antagonist antibody derived polypeptide, 
or other PCSK9 antagonists described herein. Examples of 
such compositions, as well as how to formulate them, are also 
described in an earlier section and below. In one embodiment, 
the composition further comprises a PCSK9 antagonist. In 
another embodiment, the composition comprises one or more 
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies. In other embodiments, the 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody recognizes human PCSK9. In 
still other embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist antibody is 
humanized. In yet other embodiments, the PCSK9 antagonist 
antibody comprises a constant region that does not trigger an 
unwanted or undesirable immune response, such as antibody- 
mediated lysis or ADCC. In other embodiments, the PCSK9 
antagonist antibody comprises one or more CDR(s) of the 
antibody (such as one, two, three, four, five, or, in some 
embodiments, all six CDRs). In some embodiments, the 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody is human. 
[0225] It is understood that the compositions can comprise 
more than one PCSK9 antagonist antibody (e. g. , a mixture of 
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies that recognize different 
epitopes of PCSK9). Other exemplary compositions com- 
prise more than one PCSK9 antagonist antibodies that recog- 
nize the same epitope(s), or different species of PCSK9 
antagonist antibodies that bind to different epitopes of 
PCSK9.

[0226] The composition used in the present invention can 
further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, 
excipients, or stabilizers (Remington: The Science and Prac- 
tice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. , 2000, Lippincott Williams and 
Wilkins, Ed. K. E. Hoover), in the form of lyophilized for- 
mulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipi- 
ents, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages 
and concentrations, and may comprise buffers such as phos- 
phate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including 
ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octade- 
cyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium 
chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; 
phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as 
methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohex- 
anol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less 
than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum 
albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers 
such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, 
glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine;

including glucose, mannose, or dextrans; chelating agents 
such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or 
sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal 
complexes (e. g. , Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic 
surfactants such as TWEEN, PLURONICS™ or polyeth- 
ylene glycol (PEG). Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients 
are further described herein. 
[0227] In one embodiment, the antibody is administered in 
a formulation as a sterile aqueous solution having a pH that 
ranges from about 5. 0 to about 6. 5 and comprising from about 
I mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml of antibody, from about I mil- 
limolar to about 100 millimolar of histidine buffer, from 
about 0. 01 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml of polysorbate 80, from 
about 100 millimolar to about 400 millimolar of trehalose, 
and from about 0. 01 millimolar to about 1. 0 millimolar of 
disodium EDTA dihydrate. 
[0228] The PCSK9 antagonist antibody and compositions 
thereof can also be used in conjunction with other agents that 
serve to enhance and/or complement the effectiveness of the 
agents. 
D. Kits 
[0229] The invention also provides kits for use in the instant 
methods. Kits of the invention include one or more containers 
comprising a PCSK9 antagonist antibody (such as a human- 
ized antibody) or peptide described herein and instructions 
for use in accordance with any of the methods o f the invention 
described herein. Generally, these instructions comprise a 
description of administration of the PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body, peptide, or aptamer for the above described therapeutic 
treatments. 
[0230] In some embodiments, the antibody is a humanized 
antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is human. In 
other embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. 
The instructions relating to the use of a PCSK9 antagonist 
antibody generally include information as to dosage, dosing 
schedule, and route of administration for the intended treat- 
ment. The containers may be unit doses, bulk packages (e. g. , 
multi-dose packages) or sub-unit doses. Instructions supplied 
in the kits of the invention are typically written instructions on 
a label or package insert (e. g. , a paper sheet included in the 
kit), but machine-readable instructions (e. g. , instructions car- 
ried on a magnetic or optical storage disk) are also acceptable. 
[0231] The kits of this invention are in suitable packaging. 
Suitable packaging includes, but is not limited to, vials, 
bottles, jars, flexible packaging (e. g. , sealed Mylar or plastic 
bags), and the like. Also contemplated are packages for use in 
combination with a specific device, such as an inhaler, nasal 
administration device (e. g. , an atomizer) or an infusion device 
such as a minipump. A kit may have a sterile access port (for 
example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or 
a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection 
needle). The container may also have a sterile access port (for 
example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or 
a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection 
needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a 
PCSK9 antagonist antibody. The container (e. g. , pre-filled 
syringe or autoinjector) may further comprise a second phar- 
maceutically active agent. 
[0232] Kits may optionally provide additional components 
such as buffers and interpretive information. Normally, the kit 
comprises a container and a label or package insert(s) on or 
associated with the container. 
Mutations and Modifications 
[0233] To express the PCSK9 antibodies of the present 
invention, DNA fragments encoding V~ and Vz regions can 
first be obtained using any of the methods described above. 
Various modifications, e. g. , mutations, deletions, and/or 
additions can also be introduced into the DNA sequences 
using standard methods known to those of skill in the art. For 
example, mutagenesis can be carried out using standard 
methods, such as PCR-mediated mutagenesis, in which the 
mutated nucleotides are incorporated into the PCR primers 
such that the PCR product contains the desired mutations or 
site-directed mutagenesis. 
[0234] One type of substitution, for example, that may be 
made is to change one or more cysteines in the antibody, 
which may be chemically reactive, to another residue, such 
as, without limitation, alanine or serine. For example, there 
can be a substitution of a non-canonical cysteine. The substi- 
tution can be made in a CDR or framework region of a 
variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. In 
some embodiments, the cysteine is canonical. 
[0235] The antibodies may also be modified, e. g. , in the 
variable domains of the heavy and/or light chains, e g. , to alter 
a binding property of the antibody. For example, a mutation 
may be made in one or more of the CDR regions to increase 
or decrease the K~ of the antibody for PCSK9, to increase or 
decrease k + or to alter the binding specificity of the antibody. 
Techniques in site-directed mutagenesis are well-known in 
the art. See, e. g. , Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. , supra. 
[0236] A modification or mutation may also be made in a 
framework region or constant domain to increase the half-life 
of a PCSK9 antibody. See, e. g. , PCT Publ. No. WO 00/09560. 
A mutation in a framework region or constant domain can 
also be made to alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to 
provide a site for covalent or non-covalent binding to another 
molecule, or to alter such properties as complement fixation, 
FcR binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotox- 
icity. According to the invention, a single antibody may have 
mutations in any one or more of the CDRs or framework 
regions of the variable domain or in the constant domain. 
[0237] In a process known as "germlining", certain amino 
acids in the V~ and Vz sequences can be mutated to match 
those found naturally in germline V~ and Vz sequences. In 
particular, the amino acid sequences of the framework 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
24 
Mar. 18, 2010 
regions in the V~ and V~ sequences can be mutated to match 
the germline sequences to reduce the risk of immunogenicity 
when the antibody is administered. Germline DNA sequences 
for human V~ and V~ genes are known in the art (see e. g. , the 
"Vbase" human germline sequence database; see also Kabat, 
E. A. , et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological 
Interest, Fifth Edition, U. S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242; Tomlinson et al. , 1992, J. 
Mol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox et al. , 1994, Eur. J. Immu- 
nol. 24:827-836. 
[0238] Another type of amino acid substitution that may be 
made is to remove potential proteolytic sites in the antibody. 
Such sites may occur in a CDR or framework region of a 
variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. 
Substitution of cysteine residues and removal of proteolytic 
sites may decrease the risk of heterogeneity in the antibody 
product and thus increase its homogeneity. Another type of 
amino acid substitution eliminates asparagine-glycine pairs, 
which form potential deamidation sites, by altering one or 
both of the residues. In another example, the C-terminal 
lysine of the heavy chain of a PCSK9 antibody of the inven- 
tion can be cleaved. In various embodiments of the invention, 
the heavy and light chains of the PCSK9 antibodies may 
optionally include a signal sequence. 
[0239] Once DNA fragments encoding the V~ and V~ seg- 
ments of the present invention are obtained, these DNA frag- 
ments can be further manipulated by standard recombinant 
DNA techniques, for example to convert the variable region 
genes to full-length antibody chain genes, to Fab fragment 
genes, or to a scFv gene. In these manipulations, a V~- or 
V~-encoding DNA fragment is operatively linked to another 
DNA fragment encoding another protein, such as an antibody 
constant region or a flexible linker. The term "operatively 
linked", as used in this context, is intended to mean that the 
two DNA fragments are joined such that the amino acid 
sequences encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in- 
frame. 
[0240] The isolated DNA encoding the V~ region can be 
converted to a full-length heavy chain gene by operatively 
linking the V~encoding DNA to another DNA molecule 
encoding heavy chain constant regions (CH I, CH2 and CH3). 
The sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes 
are known in the art (see e. g. , Kabat, E. A. , et al. , 1991, 
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edi- 
tion, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH 
Publ. No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these 
regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The 
heavy chain constant region can be an IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, 
IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region, but most pref- 
erably is an IgGI or IgG2 constant region. The IgG constant 
region sequence can be any of the various alleles or allotypes 
known to occur among different individuals, such as Gm(1), 
Gm(2), Gm(3), and Gm(17). These allotypes represent natu- 
rally occurring amino acid substitution in the IgGI constant 
regions. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the VH-encod- 
ing DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule 
encoding only the heavy chain CH I constant region. The CH I 
heavy chain constant region may be derived from any of the 
heavy chain genes. 
[0241] The isolated DNA encoding the V~ region can be 
converted to a full-length light chain gene (as well as a Fab 
light chain gene) by operatively linking the V~-encoding 
DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain 
constant region, C~. The sequences of human light chain 
constant region genes are known in the art (see e. g. , Kabat, E. 
A. , et al. , 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological 
Interest, Fifth Edition, U. S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments 
encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR 
amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa 
or lambda constant region. The kappa constant region may be 
any of the various alleles known to occur among different 
individuals, such as Inv(1), Inv(2), and Inv(3). The lambda 
constant region may be derived from any of the three lambda 
genes. 
[0242] To create a scFv gene, the V~ and V~-encoding 
DNA fragments are operatively linked to another fragment 
encoding a flexible linker, e. g. , encoding the amino acid 
sequence (Gly4-Ser)3, such that the V~ and V~ sequences can 
be expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the V~ 
and V~ regions joined by the flexible linker (See e g. , Bird et 
al. , 1988, Science 242:423-426; Huston et al. , 1988, Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; McCafferty et al. , 1990, 
Nature 348:552-554. The single chain antibody may be 
monovalent, if only a single V~ and V~ are used, bivalent, if 
two V~ and V~ are used, or polyvalent, if more than two V~ 
and V~ are used. Bispecific or polyvalent antibodies may be 
generated that bind specifically to PCSK9 and to another 
molecule. 
[0243] In another embodiment, a fusion antibody or immu- 
noadhesin may be made that comprises all or a portion of a 
PCSK9 antibody of the invention linked to another polypep- 
tide. In another embodiment, only the variable domains of the 
PCSK9 antibody are linked to the polypeptide. In another 
embodiment, the V~ domain of a PCSK9 antibody is linked to 
a first polypeptide, while the V~ domain of a PCSK9 antibody 
is linked to a second polypeptide that associates with the first 
polypeptide in a manner such that the V~ and V~ domains can 
interact with one another to form an antigen binding site. In 
another preferred embodiment, the VH domain is separated 
from the V~ domain by a linker such that the VH and VL 
domains can interact with one another. The V~linker-V~ 
antibody is then linked to the polypeptide of interest. In 
addition, fusion antibodies can be created in which two (or 
more) single-chain antibodies are linked to one another. This 
is useful if one wants to create a divalent or polyvalent anti- 
body on a single polypeptide chain, or if one wants to create 
a bispecific antibody. 
[0244] In other embodiments, other modified antibodies 
may be prepared using PCSK9 antibody encoding nucleic 
acid molecules. For instance, "Kappa bodies" (Ill et al. , 1997, 
Protein Eng. 10:949-57), "Minibodies" (Martin et al. , 1994, 
EMBO J. 13:5303-9), "Diabodies" (Holliger et al. , 1993, 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448), or "Janusins" 
(Traunecker et al. , 1991, EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 and Trau- 
necker et al. , 1992, Int. J. Cancer (Suppl. ) 7:51-52) may be 
prepared using standard molecular biological techniques fol- 
lowing the teachings of the specification. 
[0245] Bispecific antibodies or antigen-binding fragments 
can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of 
hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e. g. , Songsiv- 
ilai & Lachmann, 1990, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321, 
Kostelny et al. , 1992, J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553. In addi- 
tion, bispecific antibodies may be formed as "diabodies" or 
"Janusins. " In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody 
binds to two different epitopes of PCSK9. In some embodi- 
ments, the modified antibodies described above are prepared

Generating and Screening PCSK9 Antagonist Anti- 
bodies 
General Procedures for Immunization ofAnimals for Gener- 
ating Monoclonal Antibodies: 
[0249] Balb/c or 129/b16 pcsk9 — / — mice were injected 5 
times on a 13 day schedule with 100 pg antigen. PCSK9 — /— 
(that is, null or knock-out mice) can be obtained from, or as 
described by, Rashid et al. , 2005, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 
102: 5374. See also U. S. Pat. No. 7, 300, 754. For the first 4 
injections, antigen was prepared by mixing the recombinant 
proteins with adjuvant. Immunogen was given via inj ection to 
the scruff of the neck, the foot pads and intraperitoneally, 
approximately every 3 days over the course of 11 days, with 
the last boost administered i. v. , without adjuvant. On Day 13, 
the mice were euthanized and their spleens were removed. 
Lymphocytes were immortalized by fusion with an estab- 
lished cell line to make hybridoma clones using standard 
hybridoma technology, distributed into 96 well plates. Clones 
[0246] More than 500 polyclonal and monoclonal antibod- 
ies raised against recombinant full-length human PCSK9, 
recombinant full length mouse PCSK9, and various synthetic 
peptides were evaluated for their ability to down regulate total 
LDLR protein in cultured Huh7 human liver cells. Among 
these antibodies were a set of antibodies raised to and reactive 
with a set of 12-20 amino acid residue polypeptides that, 
based on the structure of PCSK9, were predicted to cover 
majority of the protein surface. At the highest concentration, 
the best antibodies exhibited only about 60% blocking activ- 
ity. 
[0247] Thus, an alternative and heretofore unexplored 
approach was employed, namely, the generation of mono- 
clonal antibodies by immunizing PCSK9 null mice with 
recombinant full-length PCSK9 protein. This manner of anti- 
body preparation yielded antagonist antibodies that show 
complete blocking of PCSK9 binding to LDLR, complete 
blocking of PCSK9-mediated lowering of LDLR levels in 
Huh7 cells, and lowering of LDLc in vivo including in mice 
to levels comparable to that seen in PCSK9 — / — mice, as 
shown in Example 7. 
[0248] Representative antibodies (hybridomas) of the 
present invention were deposited in the American Type Cul- 
ture Collection (ATCC) on Feb. 28, 2008, and were assigned 
the accession numbers in Table 3. Hybridomas were depos- 
ited for antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6 and 7D4. 
ELISA Screening of Antibodies: 
[0250] Supernatant media from growing hybridoma clones 
were screened separately for their ability to bind the recom- 
binant human PCSK9 or recombinant mouse PCSK9. The 
assays were performed with 96-well plates coated overnight 
with 100 pl of a I pg/ml solution of one of the antigens. 
Excess reagents were washed from the wells between each 
step with PBS containing 0. 05% Tween-20. Plates were then 
blocked with PBS containing 0. 5% BSA. Supernatant was 
added to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 
hours. Horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat-anti 
mouse Fc was added to bind to the mouse antibodies bound to 
the antigen. Tetramethyl benzidine was then added as sub- 
strate for HRP to detect the amount of mouse antibody present 
in the supernatant. The reaction was stopped and the relative 
amount of antibody was quantified by reading the absorbance 
at 450 nm. Hybridoma clones that secreted antibodies that are 
capable of binding to either mouse or human PCSK9 were 
selected for further analysis. 
PCSK9-Mediated LDLR Down-Regulation in Huh7 Cells 
[0251] Hybridoma clones secreting human or mouse 
PCSK9 binding antibodies were expanded and supernatants 
were harvested. Total IgGs were purified from approximately 
10 ml of the supernatant using protein A beads, dialyzed into 
PBS buffer, and the final volume reduced to yield solutions 
with 0. 7-1 mg/ml of antibodies. Purified antibodies were then 
used to test their ability to inhibit the ability of PCSK9 to 
mediate LDLR down-regulation in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cells 
were plated and allowed to grow to 80% confluency in RPMI 
media containing 10% FBS, 4 mM glutamine, and penicillin 
and streptavidin in 96 well plates. The medium was changed 
to one containing 10% de-lipidated FBS for 8-16 hrs to induce 
LDLR expression. Cells were then incubated for 8-16 hours 
with 40 pl/well of 293 expression media supplemented with 6 
pg/ml ofhuman (preferably) or mouse PCSK9, with or with- 
out 70-100 pg/ml of test antibodies. The PCSK9 and antibody 
containing media were removed at the end of incubation, and 
cells were lysed with 17 pl lysis buffer by shaking at 4 C for 
an hour. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM glycerol phos- 
phate, 10 mM HEPES pH 7. 4, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM 
NaCI, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). Cell 
lysates were collected and analyzed for LDLR protein levels 
via staining of Western blots following SDS polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis. Hybridoma clones producing antibodies 
that can partially or fully rescue LDLR level were selected for 
further analysis. By "LDLR down regulation assay" is meant 
the above assay using Huh7 cells. 
[0252] FIG. 1 illustrates the effect of anti-PCSK9 antago- 
nistic monoclonal antibodies 7D4. 4, 4AS. G3, 6F6. G103 and

regulate LDLR in cultured Huh7 cells. 100 nM of mouse or 
human recombinant PCSK9, and a serial dilution of 25-800 
nM of antibodies were used. A) mouse PCSK9. B) human 
PCSK9. The figures are Western blots showing that the anti- 
bodies are in general more effective in blocking the function 
of human PCSk9 than mouse PCSK9. The several antibodies

Analysis of the Effect of PCSK9 Antibodies on 
PCSK9-LDLR Interaction 
[0255] PCSK9 has been shown to bind LDLR with an affi- 
nit of 180 nM under neutral pH (Cunningham et al. , 2007, Nat 
Struct Mol Biol, 14(5):413-9). Recombinant mouse or human 
PCSK9 protein was biotinylated using the Pierce reagents 
following the manufacture's instructions. ELISA plates 
(Corning Mixisorb) were coated with a solution of I pg/ml 
recombinant LDLR extracellular domain (R&D Systems) in 
each well at 4 C overnight, blocked with 2% BSA+PBS for 2 
hrs at room temperature, and then washed 5 times with wash- 
ing buffer (I xPBS+0. 05% Tween-20). Wells were incubated 
with 50 pl of indicated concentrations of biotinylated PCSK9 
protein for I hr RT. LDLR-PCSK9 binding can be stabilized 
by adding 50 pl of 4% FDH+4% sucrose+PBS solution and 
incubate for 5 min. Wells were washed 5 times with washing 
buffer, incubated with I:2000 dilution of HRP conjugated 
Strepavidin (Invitrogen) for I hr at RT, washed 5 times with 
Example 2 
Determining Antibody Binding Affinity 
[0253] The affinities of PCSK9 antibodies to PCSK9 were 
measured on a surface plasmon resonance Biacore 3000 bio- 
sensor equipped with a research-grade sensor chip using 
HBS-EP running buffer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden 
now GE Healthcare). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ms IgGs were 
amine-coupled at saturating levels onto the chip using a stan- 
dard N-hydroxysuccinimide/ethyldimethylaminopropyl car- 
bodiimide (NHS/EDC) chemistry. The buffer was switchedto 
HBS-EP+ I mg/mL BSA+ I mg/mL CM-dextran. Full-length 
PCSK9 IgGs were diluted to about 15 pg/mL and captured for

[0254] Dissociation was monitored for 5 min. The chip was 
regenerated after the last injection of each titration with two

Epitope Mapping/Binding of Antibodies using the 
Crystal Structure of the LIL3:PCSK9 Complex, Bia- 
core, and Mutagenesis 
[0258] a. Crystal structure of the LI L3:PCSK9 complex. 
The residues were identified by calculating the difference in 
accessible surface area between the LIL3:PCSK9 crystal 
structure and PCSK9 structure alone. PCSK9 residues that 
show buried surface area upon complex formation with L I L3 
antibody were included as a part of the epitope. The solvent 
accessible surface of a protein was defined as the locus of the 
centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule of 
1. 4 A. radius) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the 
protein. The solvent accessible surface area was calculated by 
generating surface points on an extended sphere about each 
atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of 
the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie 
within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms 
as implemented in program AREAIMOL (Brlggs, P. J. , 2000, 
CCP4 Newsletter No. 38, CCLRC, Daresbury). 
[0259] The result of the crystal structure analysis are shown 
in FIG. 23. FIG. 23A shows the crystal structure of the 
PCSK9 (light gray surface representation) bound to the L I L3 
antibody (black cartoon representation). The epitope for 
L I L3 binding to PCSK9 involves residues 153-155, 194, 197, 
237-239, 367, 369, 374-379 and 381 of the PCSK9 amino 
acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:53). By comparison, the epitope 
for the LDLR EGF domain binding to PCSK9 involves resi- 
dues 153-155, 194, 238, 367, 369, 372, 374-375, and 377-381 
(Kwon et al. , 2008, PNAS 105: 1820-1825). 
[0260] b. Group antibodies and epitopes based on compe- 
tition in PCSK9 binding. Full-length IgGs were amine- 
coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (three per chip at about 7000RU 
final), using a standard EDC/NHS-mediated amine-coupling 
chemistry. One flow cell was left unmodified to provide a 
reference channel. Human-PCSK9 (100 nM) was premixed 
with an array of IgGs (final 500 nM) and these complexes 
were injected over the chip using I min injections at 10 
pL/min. Antibodies that bind to competing epitopes will 
block the binding of PCSK9 to the antibody immobilized on

[0264] f. Biacore binding of the mutants to immobilized 
LDLR. Recombinant LDLR extracelluar domain protein was 
immobilized onto a Biacore SA chip. Each mutant protein 
was injected to the Biacore-3000 M) in duplicates at 25 mM 
to 0. 012 mM at five concentrations (from I' C. , with a run- 
ning buffer of 50 mM Tris pH 7. 5, 2 mM CaC12, 200 mM 
the chip. Alternatively, a classical sandwich approach was 
used by first injecting human-PCSK9 at 50 nM for I min at 10 
[IL/min (to tether it via the IgG on the chip) and then binding 
an array of IgGs (final 500 nM each) for 2 mins each. The 
immobilized IgGs were regenerated with a mild acid (Pierce 
gentle elution buffer+I M NaCI). Antibodies directed to 
known different epitopes were used as controls for positive 
sandwich formation in this assay. 
[0261] c. Structure-guided mutagenesis to map antibody 
binding epitopes. Based on the crystal structure of PCSK9 
and the likely involvement of D374 in LDLR binding (Cun- 
ningham et al. , 2007, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 14(5): 413-419), 
nineteen PCSK9 surface-residue mutants (F379A, 1369A, 
R194A, D374Y, D238R, T377R, K222A, R199A, F216A, 
R218A, R237A, D192R, D367R, R165A, R167A, A443T, 
A53V, 1474V, H449A) near or far from the position of D374 
were chosen for mutation to map the antibody binding 
epitopes. 
[0262] d. Mutant and antibody production. The 19 single 
point mutants were generated from the previously described 
wild-type DNA construct (Cunningham et al. , 2007, supra) 
using standard DNA techniques. The mutant proteins were 
expressed using transient transfection in HEK293T cells and 
secreted into the cell media. The mutant proteins were puri- 
fied with the high-throughput AKTA Xpress system (GE 
Healthcare) by Ni and size-exclusion chromatography 
steps, using conditions similar to those described earlier. Pro- 
tein concentrations were determined using the LabChip 
instrument (Bio-Rad). The PCSK9-blocking murine antibod- 
ies 4A5, 7D4, 5AIO and 6F6 were expressed with transient 
transfection in HEK293F cells and purified with a protein G 
column eluted with 0. 1 M Glycine buffer at pH 2. 8 and 
neutralized into 1. 0 M Tris at pH 9. 0. 
[0263] e. The regions of PCSK9 that are contacted by 
monoclonal antibodies 5AI 0 and 7D4 (preparation described 
later herein) were determined by protein tomography (Sidec 
A B, Stockholm, Sweden). The loops at positions 186-200, 
371-379, 176-181, 278-283, 449-453, 402-406, and 236-245 
of PCSK9 were proximal to amino acid residues of the anti- 
body. The sequences corresponding to the loops are shown in 
Table 5, and in a preferred embodiment, the antagonists o f the 
invention bind to one or more of these sequences in PSCK9. 
NaCI, 0. 02% P20 and I mg/ml BSA. All the results fit nicely 
to a I:I binding kinetics model. As expected, mutation at 
residues in direct contact with the EGF-A domain (F379A, 
R194A, 1369A, T377R, D238R) significantly weakens (by 
10-100 fold) LDLR binding. Moreover, three mutants not in 
contact with EGF-A (R199A, R218A, K222A) showed 
weaker binding (5-15 fold). This new finding suggests that 
they are involved in binding other domains of LDLR. Overall, 
these experiments validate the integrity and activity of the 
mutants for subsequent epitope mapping experiments. 
[0265] g. Binding of the mutants to immobilized 4A5, 7D4, 
5AIO and 6F6 antibodies. Biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibod- 
ies were immobilized on SA chips using standard methods. 
Mutant binding experiments were performed using Biacore 
3000 at 25' C. with a running buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCI pH 
7. 5, 150 mM NaCI and 0. 02% P20. Mutants were tested at 
333 nM or 111 nM concentrations in duplicates, with the ones 
giving weakened binding compared to the wild-type as the 
residues involved in mAb binding (listed below).

Cloning and Sequencing of Antibodies 
[0266] One million hybridoma cells were homogenized 
using the QIAshredder spin columns and total RNA was 
extracted according to RNAeasy Micro kit from QIAGEN. 
cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III RT kit from 
Invitrogen. Variable regions from the PCSK9 antibodies were 
cloned using the mouse IgG-Primer Sets from Novagen, 
which consist of degenerate primers for cloning mouse IgG 
heavy chain genes and the mouse kappa or lambda light 
chains. PCR cycling conditions were the followings: I cycle 
at 92 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 44 C for 30 
sec and 72C for2 min; two cycles at 94C for30 sec, 46C for 
30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 48 C 
for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; two cycles at 94 C for 30 sec, 
50C for30 sec and72C for2min;two cycles at 94C for30 
sec, 52 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles 
at 94 C for 30 sec, 54 C for 30 sec and 72 C for 45 sec. The 
resulting PCR products were cloned into Topo-TA cloning 
vector from Invitrogen and sequenced. The cloned antibody 
sequences were confirmed by ¹erminal sequencing of the 
first 10 amino acids of the original antibodies produced from 
ascites.

Generation of Antigens for Immunization 
[0267] Recombinant human PCSK9 protein was produced 
as reported Cunningham et al. , 2007, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 
14(5):413-9. To produce recombinant mouse PCSK9 protein, 
the cDNA of mouse PCSK9 was cloned into mammalian 
expression vector PRK5 with the addition of a 6-His tag at the 
C-terminus by methods known in the art, transiently trans- 
fected and expressed in HEK293 cells. Recombinant protein 
was purified from conditioned media using a Ni column.

PCSK9-Specific Antibodies as PCSK9 Antagonists 
1. Identification of PCSK9-Specific Antagonist Antibodies 
[0269] a. Identification of PCSK9-Blocking Antibodies 
[0270] Murine antibodies to human and/or mouse PCSK9 
were generated by immunizing mice with human-PCSK9 and 
mouse-PCSK9 synthetic peptides as prepared in Example 6 
or recombinant proteins, and screening antibodies by ELISA 
assay using human and/or mouse PCSK9 recombinant pro- 
tein as the antigens as described in Example I and other 
standard hybridoma procedures. Over 500 positive clones 
were obtained and allowed to grow to confluency in 6 well 
plates with 10 ml media. Media supernatant were collected 
and total IgGs in the conditioned media were purified using 
mAb Select (Pierce). The ability of purified and concentrated 
mouse IgGs to inhibit mouse and human PCSK9 function was 
tested in Huh7 cells using the methods described in Example 
1. Hybridoma clones expressing IgGs that showed some 
degrees of blocking were expanded and retested. 60 promis- 
ing clones were subcloned, expanded, and injected into either 
Balb/c or nude mice to produce ascites. Antibodies purified 
from ascites fluid were retested for their ability to inhibit the 
down regulation of LDLR by human or mouse PCSK9 in 
Huh7 cells. Four hybridoma clones, 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 
7D4, were identified as being able to completely inhibit 
human PCSK9 function, and at least partially inhibit mouse 
PCSK9 function. To determine ICso of each of these blocking 
antibodies, a serial dilution of IgGs were used in the assay, 
starting from 100 )Ig/ml to 3. 125 )Ig/ml, with human and 
mouse PCSK9 concentration being constant at 6 )Ig/ml. 
b. Effect of PCSK9 Antagonists on PCSK9-LDLR Binding 
[0271] PCSK9 has been shown to be co-localized with 
LDLR in cellular compartments (Lagace et al. , 2006, J Clin 
Inv, 116(11):2995-3005. Recombinant PCSK9 protein also 
binds to LDLR extracellular domain in vitro (Fisher et al. , 
2007, JBC, 282(28):20502-12. To determine the relationship 
between inhibition of PCSK9 mediated down-regulation of 
LDLR and inhibition of PCSK9-LDLR binding by antibod- 
ies, we tested the PCSK9 antibodies that partially or com- 
pletely blocked PCSK9 function on LDLR and representa- 
tives of antibodies that do not block. All partial antagonistic 
antibodies also partially inhibited LDLR extracellular 
domain binding to PCSK9, except one. Antagonistic antibod- 
ies that can completely block PCSK9 function, namely 4A5, 
5AIO, 6F6 and 7D4 also completely inhibited LDLR extra-

d. Determining Sequences Species Specificity of Anti- 
PCSK9 Antibodies 
[0274] To determine the species specificity of the anti- 
PCSK9 antibodies, antibodies were incubated with plasma 
from different species and the resultant complexes were puri- 
fied and probed by an independent anti PCSK9 antibody on 
Western blots. The antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 7D4 
recognized human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and rat 
PCSK9. See FIG. 5. Antibody 6G7 recognized only murine 
PCSK9 and an unrelated control antibody 42H7 did not rec- 
ognize any tested PCSK9. Id. 
e. Determining Sequences of Antagonist PCSK9 Antibodies 
[0275] The amino acid sequences of the variable domains 
of PCSK9 antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 7D4 were deter- 
mined using the method described in Example 5. The 
sequences indicate that the antibodies are related but different 
from each other. Table I shows the amino acid sequences of 
the variable regions of each antibody. Table 7 shows the CDR 
sequences of the light chains and heavy chains of Table I as 
identified by the Kabat and Chotia methods. 
cellular domain binding to PCSK9 (Table 5). 1050 values of 
these four antibodies correlates with their binding affinity to 
PCSK9. 
c. Epitope Determination of the Blocking Antibodies 
[0272] FIG. 4 illustrates the epitope binning of anti-PCSK9 
antibodies. Part A) shows epitope information of anti-PCSK9 
mAbs, determined by binding to synthetic 13-18-mer pep- 
tides or epitope binding via Biacore. Part B) shows the ability 
of immobilized antibodies 6F6, 5AIO and 4A5 to bind to 
human PCSK9 premixed with the mAbs indicated on the y 
axis by Biacore assay. 
[0273] Another monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibody, termed 
6G7, binds to recombinant mouse PCSK9 but not human 
PCSK9. See Table 6. 6G7, 4A5, 5AI0, 6F6, and 7D4 mutu- 
ally exclude each other's binding to mouse PCSK9. Chimera 
analysis between mouse and human PCSK9 reveals that 6G7 
binding to PCSK9 requires the catalytic domain. See Table 6. 
Thus the binding sites of 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6, and 7D4 overlap 
the catalytic site and/or the epitope bound by 6G7.

[0276] Anti-PCSK9 IgGs 4A5, 5AI0 and 6F6 were amine 
coupled to the Biacore chip. hPCSK9 (100 nM) was mixed 
with 500 nM of 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6 or 7D4 in various ratios and 
injected for I min at 10 )Il/min. The four antibodies mutually 
blocked one another irrespective of the assay orientation 
tested, suggesting that they all bind to competing epitopes. In 
contrast, they are able to form sandwich complexes with other 
non-fully-blocking antibodies that were mapped to specific 
regions using synthetic peptides. 
2. Effect of PCSK9 Specific Antibodies as PCSK9 Antagonist 
in Vivo 
[0277] a. PCSK9 Antagonist Antibodies Lower Serum 
Cholesterol in Mice 
[027S] To determine if PCSK9 antagonist monoclonal anti- 
bodies can affect cholesterol levels in vivo by inhibiting the 
function of extracellular PCSK9, the effect of 7D4 was tested 
against mouse PCSK9 in vitro, on serum cholesterol when 
injected into mice. 6 to 7 week old male C57/b16 mice were 
kept on a 12 hr light/dark cycle, bled to collect approximately 
70 )Il serum on day — 7. Antagonist PCSK9 antibody 7D4, and 
a control isotype matching monoclonal antibody were 
injected into male 7 week old C57/b16 mice via i. p. injections 
on days 0, I, 2, and 3. Mice were sacrificed on day 4 without 
fasting, and serum samples were collected. All frozen serum 
samples were sent to IDEXX laboratories for total choles- 
terol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
measurements. FIG. 6 shows that 7D4 lowered serum cho- 
lesterol by 48%, while the control antibody did not have any 
significant affect. Both the amount and percentage of reduc- 
tion are similar to what was reported for PCSK9 — / — mice 
(PCSK9 knock-out mice), suggesting that one can achieve 
complete or near complete inhibition of PCSK9 function 
through blocking extracellular PCSK9 only, and that intrac- 
ellular PCSK9 plays little or no role in down-regulating 
LDLR under normal physiological conditions. As expected, 
liver LDLR levels were induced in animals treated with 7D4 
compared to those treated with a control antibody (FIG. 6). 
b. A Partially Blocking Antibody Had No Effect on Blood 
Cholesterol Levels 
[0279] FIG. 7 illustrates that a partial antagonist polyclonal 
anti-PCSK9 mAb CRN6 does not affect cholesterol levels in 
mice. Two groups of 8 week old C57/b16 mice (n=10 mice/ 
group) were bled and tested for cholesterol levels on day — 7; 
dosed with 15 mg/kg/day of CRN6 or a control antibody by 
i. v. administration on days 0, I, 2 and 3; and then bled and 
tested for cholesterol levels 24 hrs after the final dose. FIG. 
7A shows that CRN6 antibody partially blocks PCSK9 medi- 
ated down regulation of LDLR in Huh7 cells in vitro. FIG. 7B 
shows that administration of CRN6 antibody does not affect 
serum cholesterol levels in mice. 
c. Prolonged Effect on Serum Cholesterol by Antagonist 
PCSK9 mAb in Mice. 
[02SO] A time course study was performed to determine the 
time of onset and duration of the cholesterol lowering effect 
of PCSK9 antagonist antibodies in mice. MAb 7D4 or saline 
control were each injected i. v. at 10 mg/kg or 3 ml/kg in 48 
6-week-old C57/b16 mice. Eight mice from each treatment 
group were sacrificed on days I, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 21 after 
injection. A single injection of 7D4 produced a fast and pro- 
longed lowering effect on serum cholesterol. A 25% reduc- 
tion in serum cholesterol was seen at 24 hrs after injection. 
See FIG. S. Maximum drop of serum cholesterol was 
US 2010/0068199 A1 
30 
Mar. 18, 2010 
observed at the 7 day time point. At 21 days, the reduction in 
cholesterol is no longer statistically significant. Part B) shows 
HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol levels were very low. 
[0281] FIG. 9 illustrates that the anti-PCSK9 antagonist 
mAb 7D4 dose dependently reduces serum total cholesterol, 
HDL, and LDL in mice. Six groups of 8 week old C57/b16 
mice (n=8/group) were bled and tested for basal cholesterol 
levels on day — 7 and administered with the indicated doses of 
antibodies or saline on days 0, I, 2, and 3 by i. p. bolus 
injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cho- 
lesterol levels 24 hrs after the last dose. FIG. 9A shows total 
cholesterol levels, which decreased to less than 60'zo of con- 
trol after administration of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. The maximal 
effect on total cholesterol was seen at 10 mg/kg, and statisti- 
cally significant reduction at I mg/kg. FIG. 9B shows HDL 
levels, which decreased to less than 70'zo after administration 
of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. FIG. 9C shows LDL levels, which 
decreased to nearly zero at all tested doses of 03 mg/kg/day 
and above. 
d. Dose Response of Antagonist Antibodies Specific to 
PCSK9 in Mice 
[0282] FIG. 10 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body 5AIO dose dependently lowers cholesterol levels in 
mice. FIG. 10A shows six groups of 8 week old C57/b16 mice 
(n=8/group) to which were administered the indicated doses 
of antibodies or saline daily on days 0, I, 2, and 3 by i. v. bolus 
injection. Serum samples were collected and tested for cho- 
lesterol levels 24 hrs after the last dose and showed a gradu- 
ated decrease with increasing dose of antibody. FIG. 10B 
shows five groups of 8 week old C57/b16 mice (n=8/group) to 
which were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or 
saline on day 0 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum samples were 
collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7 and also 
showed a graduated decrease with increasing doses of anti- 
body. 
[0283] FIG. 11 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
bodies 4A5 and 6F6 lower cholesterol levels in mice in a 
dose-dependent fashion. Eight week old C57/b16 mice (n=8/ 
group) were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or 
saline on day 0 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum samples were 
collected and tested for cholesterol levels on day 7. In FIG. 
11A, the antibody 4A5 showed a graduated decrease in total 
serum cholesterol with increasing dose of antibody. In FIG. 
11B, the antibody 6F6 showed decrease in total serum cho- 
lesterol at 10 mg/kg/day.

and 7D4 increase liver LDLR levels in mice as found by 
Western blot analysis. See FIG. 12. For 4A5, 5AIO and 6F6, 
8 week old C57/b16 mice were administered with 10 mg/kg of 
antibodies or saline on day 0 by i. v. bolus injection, animals 
were sacrificed on day 7, and whole liver lysate of 3 individual 
animals were analyzed for LDLR and GAPDH protein levels 
by Western. For 7D4, 8 week old B16/c57 mice were admin- 
istered with 10 mg/kg of antibodies on days 0, I, 2, and 3 via 
i. p. bolus injection, animals were sacrificed on day 4, and 
whole liver lysate of 3 individual animals were analyzed for 
LDLR and GAPDH protein levels by Western blot. All anti- 
body-treated mice showed high levels of LDLR as compared 
to the PBS control mice. 
[0285] FIG. 13 illustrates that anti-PCSK9 antagonist anti- 
body has no effect in the LDLR — / — mouse. Eight week old 
LDLR — / — mice (LDLR KO mice) were administered 10 
mg/kg 4A5 or saline on day 0 by i. p. bolus injection. Serum 
samples (from n=9-10 mice) were collected and tested for 
cholesterol levels on day 7. Administration of the antibody 
did not appreciably alter the levels of total serum cholesterol, 
HDL, or LDL. 
[0286] FIG. 14 illustrates that multiple treatments of anti- 
PCSK9 antagonist antibodies in mice can substantially 
decrease total serum cholesterol. Eight week old C57/b16 
mice were administered the indicated doses of antibodies or 
PBS on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 by i. v. bolus injection. Serum 
samples (n=5-11 mice) were collected and tested for choles- 
terol levels on day 28.

PCSK9 Antagonist Antibodies Lower Serum LDL in 
Non-human Primates 
[0287] To test the in vivo effect of antibodies to PCSK9, 
antibody 7D4 was tested in cynomolgus monkeys. Four 3-4 
year old cynomolgus monkey were injected with vehicle 
(PBS+0. 01'zo Tween 20) on day 0, and 10 mg/kg 7D4 on day 
7. Plasma lipid profiles were analyzed on days 0, 2, 7, 9, 11, 
14, 21 and 28 following overnight fasting. A single injection 
of 10 mg/kg 7D4 produced a dramatic reduction in plasma 
LDL (60'zo) (FIG. 15A) and LDL particle numbers (FIG. 
15D) in all 4 animals, while having minimal effect on their 
HDL levels (FIG. 15B) and HDL particle numbers (FIG. 
15E). Total cholesterol (FIG. 15C) was also reduced follow- 
ing 7D4 treatment, while triglyceride level (FIG. 15F) was 
not significantly affected. Total 7D4 (G), and total PCSK9 
levels (H) were also measured. 
[02SS] FIG. 16 illustrates the dose-response of anti-PCSK9 
antibody 7D4 on serum cholesterol levels in the cynomolgus 
monkey. Two male and two female cynomolgus monkeys 3-5 
years of age in each group were given the indicated dose of 
7D4 on day 7 and an equal volume of saline on day 0 by i. v. 
bolus injection. Plasma samples were taken at indicated time 
points and plasma LDL levels were measured. 
[0289] FIG. 17 illustrates a comparison of anti-PCSK9 
antibodies 4A5, 5AIO, 6F6 and 7D4 on serum cholesterol 
levels in the cynomolgus monkey. Two male and two female 
cynomolgus monkeys 3-6 years of age in each group were 
given I mg/kg of the indicated antibody on day 0 by i. v. bolus 
injection. Plasma samples were taken at indicated time 
points, plasma LDL levels were measured and normalized to 
that on day — 2. 
[0290] FIG. 1S illustrates the effect of anti-PCSK9 antago- 
nist antibody 7D4 on plasma cholesterol levels of cynomol- 
gus monkeys fed a 33. 4'zo kcal fat diet supplemented with 
0. 1'zo cholesterol. Six 3-5 year old cynomolgus monkeys were 
put on high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Three monkeys were treated 
with 10 mg/kg 7D4 and three with saline on the indicated 
date. LDL levels of individual monkeys were measured and 
normalized to that of the treatment day. 
Example 9 
Humanized Anti-PCSK9 Antibody 
[0291] The murine monoclonal antibody 5AI 0 was human- 
ized and affinity matured to provide the L I L3 antibody. L I L3 
has an affinity for murine PCSK9 of 200 pM and an affinity 
for human PCSK9 of 100 pM when measured by Biacore. 
LIL3 completely inhibits the PCSK9-mediated down regu- 
lation of LDLR in cultured Huh7 cells when incubated with 
100 nM human or murine PCSK9 antibody. See FIG. 19.

[0292] FIG. 20 illustrates the dose-response of LIL3, 
mouse precursor 5AI0, and negative control antibody 42H7 
to block the binding of recombinant biotinylated human 
PCSK9 and mouse PCSK9 to immobilized recombinant 
LDLR extracellular domain in vitro. FIG. 20A shows human 
PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 
7. 5. FIG. 20B shows human PCSK9 binding to human LDLR 
extracellular domain at pH 5. 3. FIG. 20C shows mouse 
PCSK9 binding to human LDLR extracellular domain at pH 
7. 5. FIG. 20D shows mouse PCSK9 binding to human LDLR 
extracellular domain at pH 53. 
[0293] FIG. 21 shows the effect on serum cholesterol of 
treatment with 10 mg/kg LIL3 in mice. Two groups (n=8/ 
group) of 8 week old 057/b16 mice were dosed with 10 mg/kg 
LIL3 or an equal volume of saline by i. p. injection on day 0, 
Serum samples were collected and assayed for cholesterol 
levels on days 2, 4 and 7. LIL3 decreased total serum cho- 
lesterol by about 40% at days 2 and 4. In another study, when 
10 mg/kg of LIL3 was administered as a single intraperito- 
neal (IP) dose to C57BL/6 mice fed a normal diet (n=10), 
serum cholesterol levels were reduced by 47% compared to 
saline treated controls, 4 days post treatment. When LIL3 
was administered as a single IP dose at 0, 0. 1, I, 10 and 80 
mg/kg (n=6/group) in a dose-response experiment in male 
Sprague-Dawley rats fed a normal diet, serum cholesterol 
levels were dose-dependently reduced, with maximum effect 
of 50% seen at 10 and 80 mg/kg, 48 hours post dosing. The 
duration of the cholesterol repression was also dose depen- 
dent, ranging from I to 21 days. 
[0294] The amino acid sequence of LIL3 fully humanized 
heavy chain (SEQ ID NO:15) is shown in Table 8. The 
sequence of the variable region is underlined (SEQ ID NO: 
54). 
[0296] FIG. 22 shows the effect of intravenous administra- 
tion of an effective dose (3 mg/kg) of antibody 5AIO (solid 
circles) or antibody LIL3 (solid squares) to each of four 
cynomolgus monkeys at day zero. The change in serum HDL 
(FIG. 22A) and serum LDL (FIG. 22B) was measured from 
— 2 to +28 days. Both antibodies resulted in greater than about 
70% decrease in serum LDL levels by about seven days, an 
effect that substantially persisted for about six more days in 
the animals administered LIL3. All the animals showed nor- 
mal liver and kidney function and near-normal hematocrits. 
[0297] LIL3 dose-dependently reduced LDL-C, with a 
maximum effect observed in the mg/kg group, which main- 
tained a 70% reduction in LDL-C levels until day 21 post- 
dosing, and fully recovered by day 31. HDL-C levels were not 
affected by LI L3 treatment in all dose groups. The animals in 
the 3 mg/kg dose group (n=4) were also given two additional 
IV doses of 3 mg/kg LIL3 on study days 42 and 56 (2-weeks 
apart). These two additional doses again lowered LDL-C and 
maintained LDL-C levels below 50% for 4 weeks. LDL-C 
levels returned to normal two weeks later. Serum HDL-C 
levels remained unchanged throughout the study. 
[0298] The efficac of LIL3 in non-human primates with 
hypercholesterolemia and pharmacodynamic interactions 
between LIL3 and HMG-CoA reductase inhibiting statins 
were investigated. Prior to the initiation of the study, the 
LDL-C levels of a cohort of cynomolgus monkeys (n=12) 
were elevated to an average of 120 mg/dL, compared to the 
normal average levels of 50 mg/dL, by feeding with a diet 
containing 35% fat (wt/wt) and 600 ppm cholesterol for over 
18 months. Surprisingly, no effect was observed on serum 
total cholesterol or LDL-C levels after the daily administra- 
tion of a medium-dose (10 mg/animal) of Crestor (rosuv- 
astatin calcium) for 6 weeks, and after a subsequent daily

levels by 56% by day 5 post treatment, and gradually recov- 
ered in 2. 5 to 3 weeks while not affecting HDL-C levels. 
Upon switching the animals to daily administration of 50 
mg/kg Zocor (simvastatin), their LDL-C levels reached a 
maximal reduction of 43% at day 5, and stabilized thereafter. 
After 3 weeks of 50 mg/kg/day Zocor administration, these 
animals were treated with a single dose of 3 mg/kg LIL3 
while still receiving 50 mg/kg/day Zocor. Administration o f 
L I L3 resulted in another additional 65% reduction in LDL-C, 
in addition to the 43% reduction by Zocor, by day 5, and 
returned to pre-dosing levels within 2 weeks. 
[0299] Other CDR amino acid substitutions were made to 
5AIO in the course of humanization and affinity maturation 
and to achieve particular properties. The sequences of the 
modified CDRs and the PCSK9 binding abilities of the anti- 
bodies containing these modified CDRs are listed in FIGS. 24 
A-G. The numbers following each sequence in FIGS. 24 A-G 
represent the SEQ ID NO for that sequence.

It is claimed: 
1. An antagonist of PCSK9 which comprises an isolated 
antibody, a peptide, or an aptamer which interacts with 
PCSK9 and, when administered to a subject, lowers the blood 
low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in said subject. 
2. The antibody of claim 1, wherein the antibody specifi- 
cally binds to PCSK9 and which is a full antagonist of the 
PCSK9-mediated effect LDL receptor (LDLR) levels as mea- 
sured in vitro using an LDLR down-regulation assay in Huh7 
cells. 
3. The antibody of claim 2, wherein the antibody is human- 
ized, human, or chimeric. 
4. The antibody of claim 2, wherein the antibody recog- 
nizes an epitope on human PCSK9 comprising amino acid 
US 2010/0068199 A1

residues 153-155, 194, 195, 197, 237-239, 367, 369, 374-379 
and 381 of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 
53. 
5. The antibody of claim 5, wherein the antibody epitope on 
human PCSK9 does not comprise one or more of amino acid 
residues 71, 72, 150-152, 187-192, 198-202, 212, 214-217, 
220-226, 243, 255-258, 317, 318, 347-351, 372, 373, 380, 
382, and 383 of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID 
NO: 53. 
6. The antibody of claim 2, wherein the antibody recog- 
nizes an epitope on human PCSK9 that overlaps with more 
than about 75% of the surface on PCSK9 that interacts with 
the EGF-like domain of the LDLR. 
7. An isolated antibody that comprises a PCSK9 binding 
region that competes with, or recognizes a first epitope of 
PCSK9 that overlaps with a second epitope that is recognized 
by, a monoclonal antibody selected from the group consisting 
of 5AIO, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line depos- 
ited with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned 
accession number PTA-8986; 4A5, which is produced by a 
hybridoma cell line deposited with the American Type Cul- 
ture Collection and assigned accession number PTA-8985; 
6F6, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited 
with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned 
accession number PTA-8984, and 7D4, which is produced by 
a hybridoma cell line deposited with the American Type Cul- 
ture Collection and assigned accession number PTA-8983. 
S. An isolated antibody which specifically binds to PCSK9 
and comprises a heavy chain variable region (VH) comple- 
mentary determining region one (CDRI) having the amino 
acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:8, 59, or 60, a VH CDR2 
having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:9 or 
61, and/or VH CDR3 having the amino acid sequence shown 
in SEQ ID NO:10, or a variant thereof having one or more 
conservative amino acid substitutions in CDRI, CDR2, and/ 
or CDR3. 
9. An isolated antibody comprising a light chain variable 
region (VL) CDRI having the amino acid sequence shown in 
SEQ ID NO:11, a VL CDR2 having the amino acid sequence 
shown in SEQ ID NO:12, and/or VL CDR3 having the amino 
acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:13, or a variant thereof 
having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in 
CDRI, CDR2, and/or CDR3. 
10. The antibody of claim 9 further comprising a VH CDRI 
having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:59 or 
8, a VH CDR2 having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ
