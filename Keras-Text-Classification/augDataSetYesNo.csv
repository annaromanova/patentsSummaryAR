"A composition comprising liposomes associated with a nucleic acid operatively encoding an antigenic protein and with an assistor protein, wherein the assistor protein shares at least one epitope with the antigenic protein, and wherein the nucleic acid and said assistor protein are associated with the same liposomes is described.",0
The composition provides an improved immune response compared to mixtures of liposomes some of which are associated with the nucleic acid and some of which are associated with the assistor protein.,0
"In particular, the nucleic acid operatively encodes an antigenic protein or protein thereof, the sequence of which is homologous, preferably identical, to that of an ‘assistor protein’ which forms part of the compositions.",0
"BACKGROUND Protein antigens from pathogens have long been used in vaccines, designed to elicit neutralising antibody or cell-mediated immune responses in the recipient, specific for the antigen.",0
"Proteins however are generally not good at eliciting certain types of cell-mediated immune response, particularly the generation of effector T-cells (including cytotoxic T-cells), which are a desirable component of the response for a great many vaccines (particularly those directed against intracellular pathogens or cancer antigens).",0
"Latterly, vaccines have been developed based on naked DNA, usually plasmid DNA produced from  E coli  but containing appropriate promoter sequences for expression in mammalian cells.",0
"These latter vaccines have transpired to be good at generating cell mediated immunity (involving effector T-cells, such as interferon-γ secreting antigen-specific T-cells and antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells), but are poor at generating antibodies against the encoded and expressed antigen.",0
Antibodies are an important component of the protective immune response for a great many pathogens—particularly bacteria and certain viruses such as the influenza viruses.,0
"Liposomal formulation has been used to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens, in the protein form, for many years.",0
"However, these studies of liposomal co-formulation of DNA with protein have generally used plasmids encoding immunostimulatory cytokines or other biologically active proteins—other than antigen itself.",0
To incorporate the protein form of the antigen itself into a vaccine composition containing a nucleic acid which is designed to express the protein in vivo would seem unnecessary.,0
"We are aware of only one publication which has used protein antigen as an additive in the formulation alongside DNA (Alvarez-Lajonchere, L., et al., Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janiero, 97(1):95-99, January 2002).",0
"Unlike the present invention, no enhancement of antibody response was seen by these authors in co-formulations of the antigen-encoding DNA and its cognate protein compared to immunisations with the protein alone.",0
"The formulations used by Alvarez-Lajonchere, et al., comprised mixtures of the active nucleic acid (a plasmid encoding the core antigen of hepatitis-C virus) plus irrelevant carrier DNA and polyethylene glycol, and the protein.",0
"Following injection, the protein and the active DNA (which were not physically associated in the mixture) would diffuse independently and reach antigen presenting cells separately.",0
"The negative findings of Alvarez-Lajonchere would suggest, to a person skilled in the art, that formulation of protein with its cognate DNA was not a promising way to achieve improved immune responses, at least not improved antibody responses.",0
In WO-A-9930733 the immune response to a nucleic acid vaccine is proposed to be enhanced by simultaneous administration of a cognate protein.,0
Both must merely be administered during the induction phase of the immune response with the protein preferably being masked or held back until after the nucleic acid has primed the immune system.,0
In others the protein antigen was formulated for delayed release in a biodegradable polymer-alum formulation admixed with naked DNA.,0
"It is also suggested that liposomal systems may be used but there are no examples as to how both protein and nucleic acid should be incorporated into such systems, nor does the specification include any quantitative results for in vivo tests but predicts results which may not in practice occur, especially class II responses.",0
"It is known that non-coding plasmid DNA has an immuno-adjuvant action when coentrapped with peptides in liposomal vesicles (Gursel, M., et al.,  Vaccine  (1999) 17:1376-1383) and that DNA with CpG motifs has an immuno adjuvant effect on naked DNA and peptide vaccines (Klinman, D. M., et al.,  Vaccine  (1999) 17:19-25).",0
"BRIEF SUMMARY In the present invention however, we imagined that if we contrived to physically associate nucleic acid, such as DNA, together with its cognate protein and entrap them, that the two entities would arrive at antigen-presenting cells together, resulting in the processing and presentation of the acquired protein form of the antigen, together with the expression of the DNA-encoded form of the antigenic protein in the same cell.",0
"Since antigen processing of expressed proteins occurs by a different pathway and with kinetics that are somewhat different to that for acquired proteins, we imagined that such co-delivery of DNA associated with its cognate protein would provide an opportunity for an additive or synergistic effect of these two modes of antigen presentation, and an improved immune response.",0
Now we have tested this new hypothesis with vesicular formulations of DNA and its cognate protein which provide for the association of the DNA and protein.,0
"Unlike Alvarez-Lajonchere, et al., we have found that special vaccine compositions are possible, of DNA associated (via liposomes) with its cognate protein, called an ‘assistor protein’, wherein enhanced antibody responses are observed following immunisation (compared to immunisation with protein alone, or with DNA alone).",0
"We find that if the DNA and the protein are formulated in separate particles, and the particles are mixed, then we see no enhancement of antibody production.",0
"These observations are consistent with our theory of co-delivery of DNA and the assistor protein to the same antigen presenting cell, although we acknowledge that there may be other theoretical explanations that can not be excluded at this time.",0
"This invention provides a composition for the co-delivery to a cell of a nucleic acid and an assistor protein comprising vesicles formed of amphiphilic components, wherein the nucleic acid operatively encodes an antigenic protein or portion thereof which shares at least one epitope with the assistor protein, the composition comprising said nucleic acid and said assistor protein being associated with the same vesicles as one another.",0
"The term assistor protein refers to whole proteins or fragments of proteins, proteins of a single type or proteins of different types.",0
"The antigenic protein encoded by the nucleic acid is generally the protein of interest, i.e., the target antigen against which a beneficial immune response is desired in a subject.",0
"The assistor protein is generally identical to the expressed form of nucleic-acid encoded antigenic protein, i.e., the conjugate protein of the nucleic acid.",0
The antigenic protein and/or the assistor protein may each (severally) comprise the full sequence of the naturally occurring protein from the relevant source.,0
"Alternatively, the nucleic acid may encode a portion only of the natural protein, including at least one of the epitopes of the assistor protein.",0
"In one favourable embodiment of the invention, said epitope is a B-cell epitope which is exposed on the surface of an infectious agent in its naturally occurring form.",0
"The nucleic acid may encode a portion only of the natural protein, including at least one of the epitopes of the naturally occurring agent.",0
"Similarly, the assistor protein should contain epitopes derived from the respective source which are (in one embodiment) surface accessible when the source is in its natural environment.",0
"Alternatively and usefully, both antigenic protein and assistor protein share epitope(s) with a secreted toxic product of a pathogen, such as tetanus toxin, appropriate to neutralisation of such toxin.",0
"Likewise, both antigenic protein and assistor protein may share epitope(s) with each other, which is/are also shared with a secreted product of a pathogen other than a toxin, such as the interleukin-10 analogue encoded by Epstein-Barr virus and secreted by cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus.",0
10  shows the immune response generated following immunization with formulations (Table 14) assessed by measurement of anti influenza (A/PR8 strain specific) response.,0
DETAILED DESCRIPTION We have formulated two related theories to explain the improved performance of the new compositions which are not mutually exclusive.,0
"The General Theory The general theory states that the enhanced performance of appropriately co-formulated material (wherein both DNA and its cognate protein are associated with a single vesicle, such that vesicles in a population have both DNA and protein) is due to the acquisition of both nucleic acid and its cognate protein (the assistor protein) by the same antigen presenting cell (be it a classical antigen presenting cell such as a macrophage or dendritic cell, or a B-cell, be it antigen specific or non-antigen specific).",0
"The co-delivery of the DNA and its cognate protein to the same cell allows a synergistic interaction in the ensuing immune response which would not be possible if the DNA were to be acquired by one antigen presenting cell, and the protein by another.",0
(Previously described compositions do not provide for or recognize the importance of co-delivery of DNA and its cognate protein to the same antigen presenting cell).,0
"The Specific Theory The specific theory states that the enhanced performance of appropriately co-formulated material (wherein both DNA and its cognate protein are associated with a single vesicle, such that vesicles in a population have both DNA and protein) involves the targeting (by antigen in the protein form, exposed at the surface of the particle) of the vesicle to antigen-specific B-cells, thereby selectively delivering both DNA and its cognate protein in a targeted manner to the same antigen-specific B-cell.",0
"Since the antigen-specific B-cells will ordinarily proliferate in the course of an immune response, these proliferating cells are likely to form better targets for transduction by the nucleic acid also present in the particle than would non-proliferating cells.",0
"As in the case of the general theory above, the co-delivery of the DNA and its cognate protein to the same cell allows a synergistic interaction in the ensuing immune response which would not be possible if the DNA were to be acquired by one antigen presenting cell (in this case an antigen-specific B-cell), and the protein by another.",0
"In the specific form of the theory, the particles are captured by the antigen-specific receptors (i.e., surface antibodies) of B-cells, and the nucleic acid plus its cognate protein (the assistor protein) are both taken up by individual antigen-specific B-cells.",0
"The efficiency of nucleic-acid-based immunisation is limited by the low transduction efficiency that is achieved in vivo with naked formulations of the antigen-encoding nucleic acid (e.g., naked DNA), such that few cells take up and express the nucleic acid of interest.",0
"In the exemplification of the present invention we have used vesicular, primarily liposomal, compositions to achieve protection of the DNA from nucleases in vivo, and to allow co-formulation of the DNA and its cognate protein (the assistor protein) in the same particle, although it should be clear to the reader that other vesicular compositions might be used to achieve association of DNA and its cognate protein to achieve the necessary properties of co-delivery herein defined.",0
"In a particular preferred composition according to the invention, the vesicles comprise liposomes formed from liposome forming materials, i.e., formed of lipid bilayers.",0
In the course of our own studies using liposomal compositions we endeavoured to obtain efficient co-entrapment and/or association of protein and DNA in the same liposomal particles.,0
We found that the liposomal compositions we have developed for packaging and protection of DNA against nucleases and for DNA immunisation (as described in our earlier case WO-A-9810748) are also very efficient at co-packaging protein at the same time.,0
"Surprisingly, under the conditions herein defined for formulation of the liposomes, the DNA and protein do not compete with one another for association or containment in the liposomal particle.",0
"Moreover, they are also capable of displaying significant quantities of the assistor protein in antigenically active form at the surface of the liposomal particle.",0
"We believe that the surface-localised protein antigen of our new composition (the assistor protein) may be capable of targeting liposomes, or liposome fragments generated in vivo from breakdown of these structures, to antigen-specific B-cells.",0
"Although liposomally formulated DNA can be targeted to receptors on antigen presenting cells, e.g., by placing ligands for cellular receptors of antigen presenting cells on the surface of liposomes (e.g., mannosyl moieties or complement proteins such as C3d), antigen itself has not previously been used as a targeting device in nucleic acid based vaccines.",0
"The new compositions allow for the simultaneous presentation by antigen-presenting cells of both the acquired protein form of the antigen (the assistor protein), plus the expressed form of the protein from its cognate nucleic acid.",0
Such composition allows a novel prime-boost effect whereby the differing kinetics of presentation of the expressed antigenic protein and the assistor protein (having maxima at different times) provide for a longer-lasting and ‘double hit’ exposure of the relevant immune cells to the antigen.,0
"Unlike other prime-boost phenomena in the nucleic acid vaccine field, the novel compositions provide prime and boost functions with a single dose.",0
Another advantageous feature of the new compositions relates to the differing modes of antigen presentation of the two forms (the added form and the in vivo expressed forms of the protein).,0
"Since acquired and expressed proteins are presented by two distinct pathways in antigen presenting cells (the former resulting in peptide presentation via class-II MHC, the latter via class-I MHC) the new invention provides for a more broadly based immune response involving the stimulation of T-helper cells (class-II restricted), class-II restricted effector T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells (class-I restricted).",0
The cellular microenvironment created by the new compositions (wherein both class-II and class-I presentation are occurring at the same antigen-presenting cell surface at the same time) allows for interactions among the differing T-cell types that engage the antigen-presenting cell.,0
"Since both T-cell types (class-I and class-II restricted) can be stimulated during interaction with the same antigen presenting cell, and by interactions with each other while simultaneously present at the antigen-presenting cell surface, the new formulation has several theoretical advantages over previously described methods and compositions for nucleic acid immunisation.",0
Here we describe that the theoretical advantages are confirmed in practice at the level of antibody responses to the antigen.,0
We predict however that further advantages will be found for the new formulation strategy in stimulating cell-mediated immunity (including T-helper cell responses and effector T-cell responses including cytotoxic T-cells).,0
"Since antibody responses to protein antigens are highly T-cell dependent, the data presented in this application on antibody production strongly suggest that the new compositions are effective at stimulating (at least) T-helper cell (MHC class-II restricted) responses.",0
"The fact that the new formulation strategy provides for simultaneous stimulation of class-II restricted helper and class-I restricted cytotoxic cells on the same antigen presenting cell, also suggests that the strategy will be effective in the stimulation of cytotoxic T-cell responses.",0
"Thus, the assistor protein will provide additional help for cytotoxic T-cell responses, i.e., it will increase the concentration and/or duration of expression of MHC class-II restricted peptide epitopes of the antigen recognized by T-helper cells at the surface of the antigen-presenting cell, increasing the opportunity for T-cell help of cytotoxic T-cell responses to the expressed form of the protein antigen presented via the class-I MHC pathway.",0
"An immune response requires co-operation between different cells of the immune system, namely antigen presenting cells (such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which are known as ‘classical’ antigen presenting cells), T-cells (T-lymphocytes) and B-cells (B-lymphocytes).",0
"B-cells have a capacity to present antigens to T-cells, in a manner which is in several respects analogous to presentation by conventional antigen presenting cells.",0
"Some B-cells however (i.e., those which are specific for a given antigen) are particularly good at antigen presentation because they are able to acquire and concentrate small antigen particles (including antigen molecules) via their antigen-specific surface-immunoglobulin receptors.",0
"Compared to non-antigen specific B-cells, antigen specific B-cells are at least 1000× more efficient at presentation of antigen to class-II restricted T-cells (Lanzavecchia, A., Antigen-specific interaction between T and B cells,  Nature  (1985) April 11-17:314(6011):537-539).",0
"Antigen specific B-cells may therefore be important targets for the compositions of the present invention, since they have the capacity to acquire particles of antigenic protein and its associated DNA.",0
In order to understand the favourable embodiments of the invention it is first necessary to appreciate the features of these differing modes of recognition.,0
"T-cells recognize peptide fragments of proteins embedded in class-II or class-I MHC antigens at the surface of cells, whereas B-cells (which ultimately produce antibody) recognize surface features of the unfragmented antigen (which is usually protein in character), via antibody-like antigen receptors on their cell surfaces.",0
"Thus whereas B-cells must recognize surface features of an antigen or a pathogen (B-cell epitopes), T-cell epitopes (which comprise peptides of about 8-12 amino acids in length), are not obliged to be present on the surface of an antigen, and may be ‘internal’ as well as ‘external’ when viewed in the context of the three-dimensional structure of the antigen.",0
"According to the ‘specific theory’ of the present invention (as defined above), the most favoured siting of a B-cell epitope is ‘surface’ on the antigen or pathogen, which facilitates the uptake and stimulation of antigen-specific B-cells by appropriately formulated liposomal [nucleic-acid+protein].",0
"However, according to the general theory of the invention (where liposomes are acquired in a non-antigen-specific manner by antigen presenting cells), an epitope (particularly a T-cell epitope) may be sited internally in the structure of the antigen, and is not required to be available or exposed on the surface of the antigen or agent.",0
In one favorable embodiment of the invention both antigenic protein and assistor protein are derived from a surface antigen of a viral protein.,0
"The proteins may have the same sequences as one another or may be mutated, may have portions deleted, or may be fused with other polypeptides, provided that they share at least one epitope (B-cell or T-cell) preferably several.",0
The portions of protein which the antigenic protein and the assistor protein have in common may be expressed in terms of their sequence homologies.,0
"It is believed that the proteins should be such that the assistor protein has at least one contiguous sequence of at least ten residues having at least 50%, preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, similarity with a contiguous sequence of the same length of the antigenic protein.",0
"Generally the respective contiguous sequences are at least fifty residues long, and have at least 90% sequence similarity, preferably at least 75% sequence similarity.",0
"More preferably the said contiguous sequences have at least 50%, preferably at least 75% more preferably at least 90% sequence identity.",0
"Sequence similarity is only one index of structural similarity however, and in the case of the ‘special theory’ (defined above) it is necessary only that the assistor protein and the encoded and expressed protein share a single B-cell epitope (defined as recognized by a single antibody recognizing the agent) without any requirement for sequence homology.",0
"The compositions of the invention are useful for generating an immune response, for instance which is sufficient to resist infection, by an infectious agent.",0
"The antigenic protein and assistor protein are thus preferably derived from a source which is an infectious agent, for instance a microorganism such as a bacterium, or a virus.",0
"Suitably the virus is a conventional virus, (as distinct from a protein-only infectious agent such as a prion), against which immune responses are known (or believed to be) capable of neutralising or eliminating the virus, for instance a hepatitis virus (such as hepatitis-B or C viruses) or an influenza virus (such as influenza-A or B viruses).",0
"Suitably the infectious agent may be a bacterium, such as a streptococcus (e.g.,  Streptococcus pneumoniae , or a member of the group-A or group-B streptococci) or an agent capable of causing meningitis such as the meningococci groups A, B & C or  Haemophilus influenzae , or organisms capable of causing ear infections in children such as  Moraxella cattharalis .",0
"Suitably the antigen may also be a host protein that is selectively expressed on or within cancerous cells or tissues, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, or CD55 (a complement control protein), or an integrin or other marker of the tumour vasculature.",0
"The target antigen of this novel vaccine composition may also be a host protein or peptide requiring neutralisation or elimination such as a harmful autoantibody, or a peptide such as the amyloid beta peptide of Alzheimer's disease in its various forms (A-beta 40 and A-beta 42).",0
"The target antigen of the vaccine may also be a carbohydrate, such as a bacterial polysaccharide, wherein the expressed form of the protein and/or the assistor protein mimic(s) the antigenic structure of said carbohydrate antigen.",0
"Suitable peptide mimics of the group-B meningococcal polysaccharide (Laing, Granoff Granoff D M and Moe G R. Molecular mimetics of meningococcal B epitopes.",0
Such peptides may be expressed as concatenated forms where the different peptide sequence embodiments of the carbohydrate epitope are joined together at the DNA level to form a polypeptide or protein comprising repeating epitopes of different sequence.,0
"According to the present invention, the target epitope(s) against which a beneficial immune response is desired should correspond to epitope(s) which are shared between the protein encoded by the DNA and the assistor protein.",0
"The location of the target epitope(s) in situ on the target antigen may be accessible to antibodies (such as neutralising epitopes of the influenza-A hemagglutinin), but alternatively may usefully also be internal in the agent (such as a heat shock protein of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis ).",0
"The assistor protein, though usually being highly similar or identical to the nucleic-acid encoded protein in the composition, may be whole virus (virion) or a ‘split’ virus preparation (such as well known detergent-lysed influenza virus preparations) provided that it contains a protein which has at least one (and preferably several) shared epitopes with the nucleic-acid encoded protein.",0
It may be desirable in the invention to include a nucleic acid that encodes for more than one protein and/or to include one or more different assistor proteins.,0
"For this embodiment, it is preferable that a single vesicle should have associated with it nucleic acid encoding for an antigenic protein which shares epitopes as described above with the antigenic or assistor protein associated with that particle.",0
"For example the composition of the invention may comprise two or more different liposome types in admixture, for instance one of which comprises nucleic acid encoding a first antigenic protein with a first assistor protein, the antigenic protein and assistor protein being related as described above, and a second liposome type comprising nucleic acid encoding a second antigenic protein associated with a second assistor protein related to the second antigenic protein as described above.",0
"Alternatively, a single liposome may contain two or more different nucleic acids, one of which encodes a first antigenic protein and the other of which encode a second antigenic protein (etc.",0
"assistor protein, the first and second assistor proteins being related to respective first and second antigenic proteins as described above.",0
"The two or more antigenic proteins may be part of the same expressed protein molecule (i.e., a fusion protein), encoded by a single nucleic acid.",0
"Alternatively, two or more separate nucleic acid components, each encoding different parts of one antigenic protein, may be included (with the protein) in a single liposome.",0
"A favourable composition may also comprise severally co-formulated DNAs and their cognate proteins (assistor proteins), provided that each DNA is associated with its cognate or assistor protein in the same liposome.",0
The same arrangement of nucleic acid and protein may be achieved in vesicular compositions of the invention formed from non-phospholipid components.,0
"Embodiments involving more than one antigenic protein, as described in the preceding paragraph, may be of particular value where the composition is to be used to generate an immune response, generally vaccinate a subject, against an infective agent which may exist in several infective strains.",0
"This embodiment of the invention is of particular value where the infectious agent is a virus, especially an influenza virus.",0
Thus the nucleic acid encoded antigenic proteins and their corresponding assistor proteins may be derived from A and B strains of influenza virus.,0
"One preferred embodiment would comprise two currently circulating (or anticipated) strains of influenza A, plus one currently circulating strain (or anticipated strain) of influenza-B.",0
"The composition would favourably comprise all six molecular entities associated with a single vesicle (e.g., a liposomal particle) such that each particle is associated with all three nucleic acids and all three proteins.",0
Another favorable embodiment incorporating influenza viruses would comprise three separately created vesicular formulations comprising {Ai protein+AiDNA}; {Aii protein+AiiDNA} and {B protein+B DNA} (where curly brackets denote the payload of an individual vesicle) mixed together in a single dose or administered in three separate doses to a recipient human or animal.,0
"In one useful embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acid is at least partially, and preferably substantially wholly, entrapped within the intravesicular space of vesicles, usually liposomes.",0
"When it is entrapped in the intravesicular space, the nucleic acid is optimally protected from its environment, but may nevertheless be delivered into the appropriate cells once administered to a subject.",0
"Alternatively, but less preferably, the nucleic acid may be complexed with the vesicles that is primarily be associated on the external surface of the vesicles.",0
"Such an arrangement provides a lower degree of protection during administration and delivery of the nucleic acid, but may also be effective.",0
"In one embodiment of the present invention the assistor protein is, preferably, at least in part, accessible at the outer surface of the vesicle.",0
"This will allow acquisition of the vesicle by antigen specific B-cells, and, following production of antibodies in the early stages of the immune response to the vaccine composition, will facilitate the uptake of antibody-complexed vesicles by antigen presenting cells via high affinity Fc-gamma receptors that recognize surface bound antigen-specific IgG on the vesicle surface.",0
"Likewise, surface located antigen on a liposomal or other vesicle will allow complement fixation, resulting in the uptake of vesicles and their fragments by complement receptors on antigen-presenting cells and B-cells.",0
"In order to achieve these results, the protein may be merely complexed with the external surface of the vesicle (e.g., by electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions, in the manner of an extrinsic membrane protein) or, preferably, is embedded in the wall of the vesicle (e.g., via a trans-bilayer hydrophobic sequence of polypeptide chain) remaining partly exposed to the extra-vesicle environment.",0
"In either instance, according to this embodiment, the epitope of interest should be accessible from the outside of the vesicle.",0
Such accessibility may be determined by carrying out binding experiments using antibodies against the respective epitope.,0
Such binding data demonstrating surface exposure are described in the figures associated with this text for our work on co-formulation of DNA and protein for influenza-A virus.,0
"Where the vesicle is liposomal, the liposome forming components used to form the liposomes may include neutral, zwitterionic, anionic and/or cationic lipid moieties.",0
"These may be used in relative amounts such as to confer an overall charge on the liposome or, less preferably, the liposomes may have no overall charge.",0
It is found that using lipid components such that the liposome has an overall positive charge can provide good results (refer to the data section of this application).,0
"In addition to components which are properly termed lipids (including glycerides and cholesterol), the liposome forming components may include non-lipidic components (i.e., which are not naturally occurring lipids) such as non-ionic or cationic surface active agents.",0
"According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the new composition comprises liposomes formed from liposome forming components including at least one cationically charged component in an amount such that the liposomes have an overall positive charge.",0
In this embodiment of the invention the cationic component incorporated into the liposome may be any of those which have been used in liposome preparations for improving transfection rate by complexation with polynucleotides.,0
"Preferred cationic lipids are 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio)propane (DOTAP), 1,2-bis(hexadecyloxy)-3-trimethylaminopropane (BisHOP), N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammoniumchloride (DOTMA) and other lipids of structure I defined in U.S. Pat.",0
"The structure is as follows: or an optical isomer thereof, wherein Y1 and Y2 are the same or different and are each —O— or O—C(O)— wherein the carbonyl carbon is joined to R1 of R2 as the case may be; R1 and R2 are independently an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group of 6 to 24 carbon atoms, R3, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, aryl or aralkyl of 6 to 11 carbon atoms; alternatively two or three of R3, R4 and R5 are combined with the positively charged nitrogen atom to form a cyclic structure having from 5 to 8 atoms, where, in addition to the positively charged nitrogen atom, the atoms in the structure are carbon atoms and can include one oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom; n is 1 to 8; and X is an ion.",0
"Preferred embodiments are compositions wherein R1 and R2 individually have from 0 to 6 sites of unsaturation, and have the structure CH 3 —(CH 2 ) a —(CH═CH—CH 2 ) b —(CH 2 ) c — wherein the sum of a and c is from 1 to 23; and b is 0 to 6.",0
"Particularly preferred embodiments are compositions wherein the long chain alkyl groups are fatty acids, that is, wherein Y1 and Y2 are alike and are —O—C(O)— Alternatively cationic lipids of the general structure I or the general structure II defined in U.S. Pat.",0
Other suitable cationic compounds are the non-lipid component stearylamine and 3β[N—N′N′-dimethylamino ethane)-carbamyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol) (a lipidic component) or analogues thereof.,0
"The liposomes, in addition to comprising cationic components, generally also comprise non-ionic and/or zwitterionic components which include lipids, which may be phospholipids or other lipids not including phosphoryl groups.",0
"Preferably the lipids include phospholipids, such as natural or synthetic phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidylserines in any of which the long chain alkyl groups (which may be joined through ester or ether linkages) may be saturated or unsaturated.",0
"The components may include non-lipidic components, for instance non-ionic surfactants such as sorbitan mono esters of fatty acids, and/or ethoxylated fatty acids or other analogues, such as ethoxylated lanolins.",0
"Best results are achieved when the liposomes include fusogenic lipids, which are usually phosphatidyl ethanolamines in which the acyl groups are unsaturated.",0
Cholesterol may be included although it may render the liposomes too stable for adequate delivery of polynucleotide into target cells.,0
"The amount of cationic component is preferably in the range 5 to 50% of the total moles of liposome forming components, preferably in the range 10 to 25% mole.",0
"The composition is preferably a vaccine, for instance adapted for administration by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, nasal, oral, other mucosal or pulmonary routes.",0
"The vesicles may be multilamellar or unilamellar vesicles and may be relatively large (vesicle diameters in the range 300 nm to 5000 nm; preferably less than 2000 nm, preferably with average diameters in the range 500-1000 nm), or small (vesicle diameters in the range 100 nm to 400 nm preferably with average diameters in the range 200 to 300 nm).",0
"Preferably the vesicles have a mean diameter not exceeding 500 nm, and preferably substantially all have diameters less than 2000 nm.",0
"Although a liposomal composition of the invention may be formed by conventional liposome forming processes, such as by dispersing the liposome forming materials from a film into a suspending medium containing the nucleic acid and the protein, followed by one or more size adjusting steps, or alternatively by co-dissolving liposome forming materials and nucleic acid and/or assistor protein in a common solvent followed by a liposome forming step involving addition of aqueous liquid, or by loading nucleic acid and/or assistor protein through the walls of preformed liposomes using concentration gradient electroporation or electrophoretic techniques, a preferred method uses a dehydration-rehydration technique.",0
"Several suitable methods of liposomal formulation are described in the book-chapter by Christopher J. Kirby and Gregory Gregoriadis: ISBN 0-471-14828-8  Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery  Editor: Edith Mathiowitz, Published July 1999 by Wiley Chapter ‘L’ for liposomes.",0
"These include (non-exhaustively) multi-lamellar liposomes prepared by the ‘hand shaken’ method; dehydration/rehydration vesicles (the method used in the present examples, which is highly efficient); and simple hydration of solvent-solubilized lipids.",0
The simultaneous presence of DNA and protein in these procedures will result in various degrees of co-entrapment and other forms of association of both entities with the liposomes.,0
Calcium phosphate may also be used to precipitate DNA and protein together resulting in a ‘protein co-formulation with DNA’ version of our invention described in WO-A-0141739.,0
Another favored method for the formation of associated DNA and its cognate protein is that published by Judith Senior and Gregory Gregoriadis ( Biochimica et Biophysica Acta  (1989) 1003:58-62).,0
This is a variant of the dehydration-rehydration method wherein the ‘assistor protein’ component of the present invention may be incorporated by covalent conjugation onto the surface of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV).,0
"Such SUV are then lyophilised, and then re-hydrated according to Senior and Gregoriadis (above), in a solution of the antigen-encoding DNA.",0
"The resulting multi-lamellar vesicles have most of the protein payload on the surface of the liposomal particle, which is a favoured embodiment of the present invention.",0
"A process according to the invention for forming a liposomal composition comprises the steps a) providing an aqueous suspension of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) formed of liposome forming materials; b) contacting the aqueous suspension of SUVs with nucleic acid which operatively encodes an antigenic protein to form an SUV-nucleic acid suspension; c) dehydrating the SUV-nucleic acid suspension to provide a dehydrated mixture; and d) rehydrating the dehydrated mixture in an aqueous resuspending medium to form a suspension of nucleic acid containing liposomes, including the step of introducing an assistor protein whereby the nucleic acid containing liposomes are associated with said assistor protein.",0
The dehydration-rehydration method results in nucleic acid being entrapped within the intravesicular space of the product liposomes.,0
"It may be contacted with the aqueous suspension of SUVs before, during or after step b and before step c. The assistor protein will become coentrapped within the intravesicular space of the liposomes with nucleic acid.",0
"In an alternative process, the protein may be contacted with the aqueous suspension of nucleic acid containing liposomes.",0
This embodiment will result in substantially all of the protein being associated with the external surface of the liposomes.,0
"In order to increase the degree of incorporation of protein, whilst still allowing exposure of epitopes at the external liposome surface, it may be desirable in some embodiments to conjugate the assistor protein to a lipophilic moiety which is suitable for embedding within the wall of the liposome, such as a fatty acyl moiety.",0
"Alternatively, the assistor protein may be chemically conjugated to a component of the liposome after step d. Where the liposome forming materials include cationic moiety such that there is an overall cationic charge on the liposomes, there may be adequate electrostatic attraction between the positively charged liposomes and the assistor protein, where this has an overall negative charge under the ambient conditions such that hydrophobic protein is needed and complexation of the protein provides a strong enough association.",0
In the invention the weight ratio of nucleic acid to assistor protein is preferably in the range 1000:1 to 1:1 most preferably the ratio is in a range between ratio 5:1 and 30:1.,0
"The weight ratio of nucleic acid to liposome forming materials is preferably in the range 1:100 to 1:1000, more preferably in the range of 1:100 to 1:300.",0
"In the process of the invention, the liposomal particles used in step a) preferably have sizes in the range 30 nm to 5000 nm, most preferably substantially all of the liposomes having diameters less than 1000 nm.",0
"The process results in product liposomes having particle sizes in the range 200 nm to 5000 nm, preferably in the range 300 nm to 2000 nm.",0
"This may involve incorporation of components into the re-suspending medium which control the liposome size (such as sugars, as described in WO-A-0156548).",0
"Alternatively the size control may involve an additional step following step d, in which the suspension is subjected to microfluidisation, passage through filters or homogenisation.",0
Sonication is a less preferred but viable option for this purpose but it results inevitably in some level of DNA fragmentation.,0
"After the process, it is preferable for the product liposomes, comprising both nucleic acid and protein, to be subjected to a purification step, in which non-entrapped nucleic, or assistor protein, or other components, are removed from the product suspension.",0
"Such purification processes may involve centrifugations, filtration, passage through a porous membrane of defined pore size, gel-exclusion chromatography, such as size exclusion chromatography, where the vesicles appear in the void volume.",0
"We have found that the present invention is highly effective for generating an immune response when administered to a subject, particularly an improved antibody response.",0
"We believe the improvement exhibited by the present invention to be due fundamentally to the co-targeting of nucleic acid and assistor protein to the same antigen presenting cells, (possibly including antigen specific B-cells), such that following encounter with a suitably formulated vesicle an individual antigen presenting cell takes up both the nucleic acid and its cognate protein.",0
"In the case of the influenza hemagglutinin, we observe that separate formulation of nucleic acid (DNA encoding hemagglutinin) and its cognate protein (hemagglutinin protein) in separate liposomal compartments or populations, followed by mixing and co-administration in vivo, does not achieve the synergistic effect of co-formulation of the DNA and its cognate protein in the same liposomal particles such that each liposome contains both DNA and its cognate protein.",0
These data support our hypothesis that the synergy of DNA with its cognate protein in eliciting an immune response (in this case against the influenza hemagglutinin) requires the appropriate formulation to allow co-targeting of both DNA and its cognate protein to the same antigen presenting cell.,0
"EXAMPLES The present invention is illustrated in the accompanying examples: Example 1 Haemagglutinin in Cationic Liposomes Materials and Methods: Lipids Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), Dioleoyl phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-(trimethylammonium)propane (DOTAP) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., UK.",0

"1 ) was preformed on formulations in the absence and presence of Triton X100 a liposome disrupting agent (note:—groups 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 1.10 and 1.12 serve as negative controls for the assay as these formulations do not contain HA protein).",0
"Formulations tested in the absence of TX100 indicate HA antigen readily detectable in formulations containing HA in which the protein is not formulated with Liposomes (Grps 1.8, 1.9, 1.10), with a small HA antigen positive signal detectable for formulations 1.1 and 1.2, presumably generated by surface exposure of HA antigen capable of being bound by antibodies employed in this assay.",0
"In the presence of TX100 a substantially greater positive signal is obtained for Liposomal groups 1.1 and 1.2, indicating detection of antigen previously (cf without TX100) contained within the Liposomal formulation.",0
Whilst formulation 1.5 and 1.6 both contain HA antigen entrapped by Liposomes in the absence of DNA in the formulation (cf 1.1 and 1.2) little HA antigenicity can be resolved.,0
The immune response generated following immunization with formulations (Table 2) was assessed by measurement of anti influenza (major protein HA) antibody response.,0
"Formulation 1.1 which consisted of both HA DNA and protein co-delivered in the same liposomal formulation produces a greater response than all the other formulations at each sera sample bleed tested (day 16, day 28 and day 42 (day 15 following the second dose)).",0
The response for this co-delivered formulation is greater in terms of magnitude (OD490 nm 1/100 dilution sera and Titre) and number of animals deemed sero positive at each bleed point.,0
Formulations 1.2 and 1.3 which also consist of co delivered protein and DNA in the same liposomal formulation fail to generate as substantial response as formulation 1.1.,0
"Formulation 1.6 provides further indication of this invention, in that in terms of protein and DNA product administered to the animal formulation 1.1 is equivalent to 1.6.",0
However in formulation 1.1 the products are co delivered in the same liposomal vehicle whilst in formulation 1.6 the DNA and protein are delivered in separate liposomal vehicles.,0
"The response to HA DNA containing formulations, excluding 1.1, (Formulations 1.3, 1.4, 1.7 and 1.10) essentially fail to generate an immune response, however this response may be dose related as Johnson, P., et al.,  J. Gen. Virol .",0

"The immunoadjuvant action of plasmid DNA in liposomes previously reported (Gursel M, et al.,  Vaccine  (1999) 17:1376-1383) is also demonstrated in the difference in responses to formulation 1.2 and 1.5.",0
"However, the synergistic effect of co-formulation of hemagglutinin protein with its appropriate (cognate) plasmid far exceed any effect attributable to the well-known immunoadjuvant effects of DNA such as those observed by Klinman (Klinman, D., et al.,  Vaccine  (1999) 19:25 19-26) for CpG motifs.",0
"Whilst the results presented are obtained following subcutaneous administration of the liposomal formulation, the proposed mechanisms of action, general and specific (plus antigen kinetics properties), should be effective by alternative routes of administration; intravenous, intra-muscular, intradermal, via nasal/pulmonary and oral routes, etc.",0

"Discussion The use of mannose ligand targeted liposomes as delivery vehicles for DNA and protein for induction of an immune response has been described previously described (Kawakami S, Sato A, Nishikawa M, Yamashita F, Hashida M,  Gene Ther .",0
"Moreover the general utility of mannose receptor mediated uptake of antigen(s) (proteins) by antigen presenting cells is recognised as a powerful component in the induction of an immune response (Lanzavecchia, A.,  Curr Opin Immunol  (1996) 8:348-354).",0
"The use of mannose ligand targeted liposomes to co-deliver both DNA and protein, within the same delivery vehicle (and likely to the same target cell) has not been reported.",0
The immune response generated following immunization with formulations (Tables 4 and 5) was assessed by measurement of anti Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) antibody response.,0
Formulation 2.1 which consisted of both HA DNA and protein co-delivered in the same liposomal formulation produces a greater response than all the other formulations at each sera sample bleed tested (day 28 and day 56 (day 28 following the second dose)).,0
The response for this co-delivered formulation is greater in terms of magnitude of both OD450 nm sera dilution and titre (endpoint read OD 0.3 units).,0
"The response to the DNA containing formulations, excluding 2.1, Formulation 2.3, generate an immune response consistent with published results (Gregoriadis G.  Pharm Res .",0

"The immunoadjuvant action of plasmid DNA in liposomes has been previously reported (Gursel, M., et al.,  Vaccine  (1999) 17:1376-1383) using the same DNA (non encoding, ISS capacity control) and protein products as described herein.",0
"The reported adjuvant action of the DNA component for antigen-pDNA co-entrapped formulation in this paper is described as modest, at approximately 3 fold (Titre, post 2 doses results).",0
"6 ), when a encoding (HBsAg) DNA component is used (Formulation 2.1) shows a 30 fold increase in response (cf Formulation 2.2).",0
"Thus the synergistic effect of co-formulation of HBsAg protein with its appropriate (cognate) plasmid exceeds any effect attributable to the immunoadjuvant effects of DNA, approximately only 3 fold, such as those observed by Gursel or Klinman (Klinman, D, et al.,  Vaccine  (1999) 19:25 19-26) for CpG motifs alone.",0

The response for this co-delivered formulation group (3.1.1) is greater in terms of magnitude of both OD450 nm sera dilution and titre (endpoint read OD 0.3 units).,0
"The response to the payload components, HA DNA and protein admixed (group 3.3), consistently generates a weaker immune response than the same payload components co-delivered (group 3.1).",0
"Indeed, using the same DNA payload (at 10 μg DNA dose) with a reduced protein payload (0.5 μg protein dose) in the same liposomal vehicle (group 3.2), produces an equivalent serum Ig immune response to HA DNA and protein admixed with 3-fold greater protein component payload (group 3.3).",0
"Group 3.4 failed to produce any specific anti Ig influenza response, however this group received no immunogenic components (PBS only) thus this result is as expected.",0
The live virus challenge results serve to indicate if the immune response induced in the mice in response to immunisation with the formulations is adequate to protect the animals from virus infection.,0
"Group 3.4 serves as a negative control, as these are essentially ‘naïve’ animals they reflect the normal profile of the virus infection following challenge.",0

9 a - d.  Discussion The immune response generated following immunization with formulations (Table 10) was assessed by measurement of anti influenza HA-PR8 and HA-Sichuan strain specific antibody responses.,0
"9 a - d.  At day 14, a clear antibody response to the Influenza antigens was detected in all experimental groups with the exception of formulation 2 (PBS) Immunization with formulation 4.3, consisting of HA DNA and proteins for both Influenza Sichuan and Influenza Puerto Rico 8, induced equivalent antibody titers, within standard error of the mean (SEM), to each of the strains as those induced following immunization with formulation 4.1 (Influenza Sichuan DNA and protein) or formulation 4.2 (Influenza Puerto Rico 8).",0
"In addition, immunization with formulation 3, consisting of HA DNA and proteins for both Influenza Sichuan and Influenza Puerto Rico 8, again induced equivalent antibody titers, within SEM, to the Influenza Sichuan strain to those induced following immunization with formulation 4.1 (Influenza Sichuan DNA and protein).",0
"In contrast, immunization with formulation 4.3, consisting of HA DNA and proteins for both Influenza Sichuan and Influenza Puerto Rico 8, induced antibody titers to the Influenza Puerto Rico 8 strain below those induced following immunization with formulation 4.2 (Influenza Puerto Rico 8) at two dilution points tested.",0
"In summary, we have found that the present invention, when applied to the delivery of multivalent (e.g., multi-strain), is highly effective in inducing antibody responses to the different strains present in the formulation.",0
"This antibody response develops quickly (antigen specific antibody titers are >1000 only 14 days after a single immunization) and it can be of the same level as that induced by the present invention when delivering only DNA and protein components of one single strain (e.g., monovalent formulations).",0
"Even in occasions when immunization with a multivalent formulation may induce a lower antibody response to one of the strains compared to that induced by the equivalent monovalent formulation, the level of this response is again high (>1000 titer) and increases with time.",0
"Therefore, the improvement caused by the present invention, and exemplified in this experiment, is the ability to induce a clear antibody response to several different antigenic strains following a single immunization with a formulation containing DNA and protein antigens from all these strains.",0

Discussion The immune response generated following immunization with formulations (Table 14) was assessed by measurement of anti influenza (A/PR8 strain specific) response.,0
Group (formulation) 6.1 which consisted of both HA DNA and protein co-delivered in the same delivery vehicle produces a greater response than all the other groups except group 6.2.,0
"The results indicate that: delivery of HA protein offers no advantage over protein alone (Group 6.4 vs Group 6.6), delivery of HA DNA alone produces no significant antibody response (Group 6.5) indeed 4 out of 5 animals fail to induce an response greater than the limit of detection of the assay (1/100 dilution sera), admix delivery of HA DNA and protein in separate vehicles (Group 6.3) offers no advantage over protein alone or vehicle delivered protein (Group 6.6 and 6.4 respectively) and co-delivery of HA Protein with a DNA (HA or OVA, Groups 6.1 and 6.2) component generates a significantly higher anti HA response than, admix delivered material or materials delivered alone (Groups 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 respectively).",0
In the context of this invention the last observation is applicable to both the “cognate” and “irrelevant” DNA component.,0
"The immune system response assayed are restricted to antibody responses and cellular mediated immune response (T helper, CTL etc) have not examined.",0
"Indeed, HA DNA alone immunisation (Plasmid DNA encoding influenza virus haemagglutinin induces Th1 cells and protection against respiratory infection despite its limited ability to generate antibody responses.",0
"(2000) July; 81(Pt 7):1737-1745, has been found to provide protection from influenza challenge in the absence of antibody responses thus based cellular mediated immune response alone.",0
"As group 6.1 “cognate” co delivery posses HA DNA as a active component of the formulation and group 6.2 “irrelevant” does not contain HA DNA as a active component of the formulation, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that group 6.1 may induce an additional cellular mediated immune response which has not been measured.",0

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to antigen binding proteins that bind to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and methods of using and making the antigen binding proteins.,0
"BACKGROUND OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007).",0
"In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004).",0
"Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al., 2005).",0
"Additionally, various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Kotowski et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006).",0
"PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006).",0
Degradation of the LDLR by PCSK9 has not been observed and the mechanism through which it lowers extracellular LDLR protein levels is uncertain.,0
"Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Rawlings et al., 2006).",0
"Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Henrich et al., 2003; Tangrea et al., 2002).",0
"Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Henrich et al., 2005).",0
"Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains (Sakai et al., 1998; Seidah et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 1999).",0
In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.,0
"The pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al., 1987).",0
"Following this initial cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity (Fu et al., 2000).",0
"When conditions are correct, maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro-domain (Anderson et al., 1997).",0
"After this second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.",0
"Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQISIP) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003).",0
"Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd.",0
"PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and measurements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable (Naureckiene et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 2003).",0

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Antigen binding proteins (such as antibodies and functional binding fragments thereof) that bind to PCSK9 are disclosed herein.,0
"In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins block or reduce the ability of PCSK9 to interact with other substances.",0
"For example, in some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to PCSK9 in a manner that prevents or reduces the likelihood that PCSK9 will bind to LDLR.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure, altering the interactions between PCSK9 and LDLR can increase the amount of LDLR available for binding to LDL, which in turn decreases the amount of serum LDL in a subject, resulting in a reduction in the subject's serum cholesterol level.",0
"As such, antigen binding proteins to PCSK9 can be used in various methods and compositions for treating subjects with elevated serum cholesterol levels, at risk of elevated serum cholesterol levels, or which could benefit from a reduction in their serum cholesterol levels.",0
"Thus, various methods and techniques for lowering, maintaining, or preventing an increase in serum cholesterol are also described herein.",0
"In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein allows for binding between PCSK9 and LDLR, but the antigen binding protein prevents or reduces the adverse activity of PCSK9 on LDLR.",0
"Following this discussion, general aspects regarding antigen binding proteins are discussed, followed by specific examples demonstrating the properties of various embodiments of the antigen binding proteins and how they can be employed.",0

"Isolated nucleic acid molecules “comprising” specified nucleic acid sequences can include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty other proteins or portions thereof, or can include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or can include vector sequences.",0
"Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of any single-stranded polynucleotide sequence discussed herein is the 5′ end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction.",0
The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences;” sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences.” The term “control sequence” refers to a polynucleotide sequence that can affect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which it is ligated.,0

"The term “transformation” refers to a change in a cell's genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA.",0
"For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state by introducing new genetic material via transfection, transduction, or other techniques.",0
"Following transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA can recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell, or can be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated, or can replicate independently as a plasmid.",0
A cell is considered to have been “stably transformed” when the transforming DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.,0
"The terms “polypeptide” or “protein” means a macromolecule having the amino acid sequence of a native protein, that is, a protein produced by a naturally-occurring and non-recombinant cell; or it is produced by a genetically-engineered or recombinant cell, and comprise molecules having the amino acid sequence of the native protein, or molecules having deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the native sequence.",0
The term also includes amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogs of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid and polymers.,0
"The terms “polypeptide” and “protein” specifically encompass PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or sequences that have deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acid of antigen-binding protein.",0
"The term “polypeptide fragment” refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion as compared with the full-length native protein.",0

"The term “isolated protein” referred means that a subject protein (1) is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found, (2) is essentially free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is associated in nature, (5) is operably associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature.",0
"Typically, an “isolated protein” constitutes at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50% of a given sample.",0
"Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can encode such an isolated protein.",0
"Preferably, the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, research or other use.",0
"A “variant” of a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen binding protein, or an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence.",0
"The term “identity” refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and comparing the sequences.",0
“Percent identity” means the percent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared.,0
"For these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any) are preferably addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., an “algorithm”).",0
"Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypeptides include those described in  Computational Molecular Biology , (Lesk, A. M., ed.",0
"), 1994, New Jersey: Humana Press; von Heinje, G., 1987, Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, New York: Academic Press; Sequence Analysis Primer, (Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds.",0
"In calculating percent identity, the sequences being compared are typically aligned in a way that gives the largest match between the sequences.",0
"One example of a computer program that can be used to determine percent identity is the GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et al., 1984,  Nucl.",0
The computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined.,0
"The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the “matched span”, as determined by the algorithm).",0
"A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3× the average diagonal, wherein the “average diagonal” is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the “diagonal” is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm.",0
"In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see, Dayhoff et al., 1978,  Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure  5:345-352 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., 1992,  Proc.",0
"Examples of parameters that can be employed in determining percent identity for polypeptides or nucleotide sequences using the GAP program are the following: Algorithm: Needleman et al., 1970,  J. Mol.",0
"48:443-453 Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., 1992, supra Gap Penalty: 12 (but with no penalty for end gaps) Gap Length Penalty: 4 Threshold of Similarity: 0 Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences.",0
"Accordingly, the selected alignment method (GAP program) can be adjusted if so desired to result in an alignment that spans at least 50 or other number of contiguous amino acids of the target polypeptide.",0
"As used herein, the twenty conventional (e.g., naturally occurring) amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage.",0
"Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids can also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention.",0
"Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, E-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline).",0
"In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.",0
"Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5′ end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction.",0
"The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences”; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences.” Conservative amino acid substitutions can encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems.",0
"Naturally occurring residues can be divided into classes based on common side chain properties: 1) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Be; 2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln; 3) acidic: Asp, Glu; 4) basic: His, Lys, Arg; 5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and 6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.",0
"For example, non-conservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class.",0

"In making changes to the antigen binding protein or the PCSK9 protein, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids can be considered.",0
They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (−0.4); threonine (−0.7); serine (−0.8); tryptophan (−0.9); tyrosine (−1.3); proline (−1.6); histidine (−3.2); glutamate (−3.5); glutamine (−3.5); aspartate (−3.5); asparagine (−3.5); lysine (−3.9); and arginine (−4.5).,0
The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art.,0
It is known that certain amino acids can be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity.,0
"In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is included.",0
"In certain embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included.",0
"It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case.",0
"In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.",0
The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0±1); aspartate (+3.0±1); glutamate (+3.0±1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (−0.4); proline (−0.5±1); alanine (−0.5); histidine (−0.5); cysteine (−1.0); methionine (−1.3); valine (−1.5); leucine (−1.8); isoleucine (−1.8); tyrosine (−2.3); phenylalanine (−2.5) and tryptophan (−3.4).,0

"In certain embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymer is randomly attached to one or more side chains of a derivative.",0
Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide.,0
Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides can be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect.,0
"Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: —CH 2 NH—, —CH 2 S—, —CH 2 —CH 2 —, —CH═CH-(cis and trans), —COCH 2 —, —CH(OH)CH 2 —, and —CH 2 SO—, by methods well known in the art.",0
"Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) can be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable peptides.",0
"In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation can be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch, Ann.",0
"Biochem., 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference for any purpose); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.",0
"The term “naturally occurring” as used throughout the specification in connection with biological materials such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature or a form of the materials that is found in nature.",0
"“Antigen binding protein” includes but is not limited to antibodies and binding parts thereof, such as immunologically functional fragments.",0
"The term “immunologically functional fragment” (or simply “fragment”) of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain (heavy or light chain) antigen binding protein, as used herein, is a species of antigen binding protein comprising a portion (regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized) of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but which is still capable of specifically binding to an antigen.",0
"Such fragments are biologically active in that they bind to the target antigen and can compete with other antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies, for binding to a given epitope.",0
"In one aspect, such a fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full-length light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will comprise a single heavy chain and/or light chain or portion thereof.",0
"These biologically active fragments can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or can be produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of antigen binding proteins, including intact antibodies.",0
"Immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, a diabody (heavy chain variable domain on the same polypeptide as a light chain variable domain, connected via a short peptide linker that is too short to permit pairing between the two domains on the same chain), Fab′, F(ab′) 2 , Fv, domain antibodies and single-chain antibodies, and can be derived from any mammalian source, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, camelid or rabbit.",0
"It is further contemplated that a functional portion of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein, for example, one or more CDRs, could be covalently bound to a second protein or to a small molecule to create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the body, possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties, or having a prolonged serum half-life.",0
"In some sections of the present disclosure, examples of ABPs are described herein in terms of “number/letter/number” (e.g., 25A7).",0
"That is, an ABP named 25A7 is not necessarily the same as an antibody named 25A7.1, (unless they are explicitly taught as the same in the specification, e.g., 25A7 and 25A7.3).",0
"In certain embodiments, the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding proteins is based on antibodies, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as “antibody mimetics”), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as “antibody conjugates”), and fragments thereof, respectively.",0
The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C H 3 domains.,0
"A “Fab′ fragment” comprises one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the VH domain and the C H 1 domain and also the region between the C H 1 and C H 2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab′ fragments to form an F(ab′) 2  molecule.",0
"A “F(ab′) 2  fragment” contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C H 1 and C H 2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains.",0
A F(ab′) 2  fragment thus is composed of two Fab′ fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.,0
"“Single-chain antibodies” are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain, which forms an antigen binding region.",0
A “domain antibody” is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain.,0
"In some instances, two or more V H  regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody.",0
"A bivalent antibody other than a “multispecific” or “multifunctional” antibody, in certain embodiments, typically is understood to have each of its binding sites identical.",0
A “multispecific antigen binding protein” or “multispecific antibody” is one that targets more than one antigen or epitope.,0
"A “bispecific,” “dual-specific” or “bifunctional” antigen binding protein or antibody is a hybrid antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, having two different antigen binding sites.",0
"Bispecific antigen binding proteins and antibodies are a species of multispecific antigen binding protein antibody and can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments.",0
"The two binding sites of a bispecific antigen binding protein or antibody will bind to two different epitopes, which can reside on the same or different protein targets.",0
"An antigen binding protein is said to “specifically bind” its target antigen when the dissociation constant (K d ) is ≦10 −7  M. The ABP specifically binds antigen with “high affinity” when the K d  is ≦5×10 −9  M, and with “very high affinity” when the K d  is ≦5×10 −10  M. In one embodiment, the ABP has a K d  of ≦10 −9  M. In one embodiment, the off-rate is <1×10 −5 .",0
"In other embodiments, the ABPs will bind to human PCSK9 with a K d  of between about 10 −9  M and 10 −13  M, and in yet another embodiment the ABPs will bind with a K d ≦5×10 −10 .",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments, any or all of the antigen binding fragments can specifically bind to PCSK9.",0
"“Antigen binding region” means a protein, or a portion of a protein, that specifically binds a specified antigen (e.g., a paratope).",0
"For example, that portion of an antigen binding protein that contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its specificity and affinity for the antigen is referred to as “antigen binding region.” An antigen binding region typically includes one or more “complementary binding regions” (“CDRs”).",0
“Framework” regions can aid in maintaining the proper conformation of the CDRs to promote binding between the antigen binding region and an antigen.,0
"2A-3D ,  3 CCC- 3 JJJ, and  15 A- 15 D. In some embodiments, the sequences for CDRs for the light chain of antibody 3B6 are as follows: CDR1 TLSSGYSSYEVD (SEQ ID NO: 279); CDR2 VDTGGIVGSKGE (SEQ ID NO: 280); CDR3 GADHGSGTNFVVV (SEQ ID NO: 281), and the FRs are as follows: FR1 QPVLTQPLFASASLGASVTLTC (SEQ ID NO: 282); FR2 WYQQRPGKGPRFVMR (SEQ ID NO: 283); FR3 GIPDRFSVLGSGLNRYLTIKNIQEEDESDYHC (SEQ ID NO: 284); and FR4 FGGGTKLTVL (SEQ ID NO: 285).",0
"In this context, a “recombinant antigen binding protein” is a protein made using recombinant techniques, i.e., through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein.",0
"The term “antibody” refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype, or a fragment thereof that can compete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen, and includes, for instance, chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies.",0
"An intact antibody will generally comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, but in some instances can include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids which can comprise only heavy chains.",0
"Antibodies can be derived solely from a single source, or can be “chimeric,” that is, different portions of the antibody can be derived from two different antibodies as described further below.",0
"The antigen binding proteins, antibodies, or binding fragments can be produced in hybridomas, by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies.",0
"Unless otherwise indicated, the term “antibody” includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below.",0
"Furthermore, unless explicitly excluded, antibodies include monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as “antibody mimetics”), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to herein as “antibody conjugates”), and fragments thereof, respectively.",0
"Each such tetramer typically is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one full-length “light” (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length “heavy” chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa).",0
The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids that typically is responsible for antigen recognition.,0
The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain typically defines a constant region that can be responsible for effector function.,0
"Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively.",0
"Within full-length light and heavy chains, typically, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids.",0
"The variable regions typically exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs.",0
"The CDRs from the two chains of each pair typically are aligned by the framework regions, which can enable binding to a specific epitope.",0
"From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable regions typically comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4.",0
"The assignment of amino acids to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.",0
"In certain embodiments, an individual variable region specifically binds to an antigen in the absence of other variable regions.",0
"In certain embodiments, definitive delineation of a CDR and identification of residues comprising the binding site of an antibody is accomplished by solving the structure of the antibody and/or solving the structure of the antibody-ligand complex.",0
"In certain embodiments, that can be accomplished by any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as X-ray crystallography.",0
"Examples of such methods include, but are not limited to, the Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, the AbM definition and the contact definition.",0
The Kabat definition is a standard for numbering the residues in an antibody and is typically used to identify CDR regions.,0
"The Chothia definition is similar to the Kabat definition, but the Chothia definition takes into account positions of certain structural loop regions.",0
The AbM definition uses an integrated suite of computer programs produced by Oxford Molecular Group that model antibody structure.,0
"See, e.g., Martin et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 86:9268-9272 (1989); “AbM™, A Computer Program for Modeling Variable Regions of Antibodies,” Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd.",0
"The AbM definition models the tertiary structure of an antibody from primary sequence using a combination of knowledge databases and ab initio methods, such as those described by Samudrala et al., “Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction Using a Combined Hierarchical Approach,” in PROTEINS, Structure, Function and Genetics Suppl., 3:194-198 (1999).",0
"By convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are typically referred to as H1, H2, and H3 and are numbered sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.",0
"The CDR regions in the light chain are typically referred to as L1, L2, and L3 and are numbered sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.",0
The term “light chain” includes a full-length light chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity.,0
The term “heavy chain” includes a full-length heavy chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity.,0
"A full-length heavy chain includes a variable region domain, V H , and three constant region domains, C H 1, C H 2, and C H 3.",0
"The V H  domain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the C H  domains are at the carboxyl-terminus, with the C H 3 being closest to the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide.",0
"Heavy chains can be of any isotype, including IgG (including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subtypes), IgA (including IgA1 and IgA2 subtypes), IgM and IgE.",0
A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites.,0
"Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments.",0
"Each individual immunoglobulin chain is typically composed of several “immunoglobulin domains,” each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and having a characteristic folding pattern.",0
"In humans, the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains; the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains; and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains and five light chains.",0
"The term “variable region” or “variable domain” refers to a portion of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody, typically including approximately the amino-terminal 120 to 130 amino acids in the heavy chain and about 100 to 110 amino terminal amino acids in the light chain.",0
"In certain embodiments, variable regions of different antibodies differ extensively in amino acid sequence even among antibodies of the same species.",0
"The variable region of an antibody typically determines specificity of a particular antibody for its target The term “neutralizing antigen binding protein” or “neutralizing antibody” refers to an antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, that binds to a ligand and prevents or reduces the biological effect of that ligand.",0
"This can be done, for example, by directly blocking a binding site on the ligand or by binding to the ligand and altering the ligand's ability to bind through indirect means (such as structural or energetic alterations in the ligand).",0
"In some embodiments, the term can also denote an antigen binding protein that prevents the protein to which it is bound from performing a biological function.",0
"In assessing the binding and/or specificity of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment can substantially inhibit binding of a ligand to its binding partner when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the ligand by at least about 1-20, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, 97-98%, 98-99% or more (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).",0
"In some embodiments, in the case of PCSK9 antigen binding proteins, such a neutralizing molecule can diminish the ability of PCSK9 to bind the LDLR.",0
"In some embodiments, ABPs 27B2, 13H1, 13B5 and 3C4 are non-neutralizing ABPs, 3B6, 9C9 and 31A4 are weak neutralizers, and the remaining ABPs in Table 2 are strong neutralizers.",0
"In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding proteins neutralize by binding to PCSK9 and preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDLR (or reducing the ability of PCSK9 to bind to LDLR).",0
"In some embodiments, the antibodies or ABPs neutralize by binding to PCSK9, and while still allowing PCSK9 to bind to LDLR, preventing or reducing the PCSK9 mediated degradation of LDLR.",0
"Thus, in some embodiments, a neutralizing ABP or antibody can still permit PCSK9/LDLR binding, but will prevent (or reduce) subsequent PCSK9 involved degradation of LDLR.",0
The use of “antigen” in the phrase “antigen binding protein” simply denotes that the protein sequence that comprises the antigen can be bound by an antibody.,0
"The term “compete” when used in the context of antigen binding proteins (e.g., neutralizing antigen binding proteins or neutralizing antibodies) that compete for the same epitope means competition between antigen binding proteins as determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof) being tested prevents or inhibits (e.g., reduces) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g., a ligand, or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., PCSK9 or a fragment thereof).",0
"Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if one antigen binding protein competes with another, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983,  Methods in Enzymology  9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986,  J. Immunol.",0
"137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988,  Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual , Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988,  Molec.",0
"25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990,  Virology  176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990,  Scand.",0
"Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein.",0
Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein.,0
Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur.,0
"Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75% or 75% or more.",0
"The term “antigen” refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antigen binding protein (including, e.g., an antibody or immunological functional fragment thereof).",0
"In some embodiments, the antigen is capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen.",0
"An antigen can possess one or more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antigen binding proteins, e.g., antibodies.",0
"The term “epitope” includes any determinant capable being bound by an antigen binding protein, such as an antibody or to a T-cell receptor.",0
"An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antigen binding protein that targets that antigen, and when the antigen is a protein, includes specific amino acids that directly contact the antigen binding protein.",0
"Most often, epitopes reside on proteins, but in some instances can reside on other kinds of molecules, such as nucleic acids.",0
"Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics.",0
"Generally, antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.",0
"As used herein, “substantially pure” means that the described species of molecule is the predominant species present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the same mixture.",0
"In certain embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present.",0
"In other embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular species present in the composition.",0
"In other embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species.",0
"The term “agent” is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.",0
"As used herein, the terms “label” or “labeled” refers to incorporation of a detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotin moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods).",0
"Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g.,  3 H,  14 C,  15 N,  35 S,  90 Y,  99 Tc,  111 In,  125 I,  131 I), fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags).",0

"Such substances include, but are not limited to, blood, serum, urine, cells, organs, tissues, bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and skin.",0
"The term “pharmaceutical agent composition” (or agent or drug) as used herein refers to a chemical compound, composition, agent or drug capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient.",0
The term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the amount of a PCSK9 antigen binding protein determined to produce a therapeutic response in a mammal.,0
"For example, a modulator can cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the modulator.",0

"The term “treat” and “treatment” includes therapeutic treatments, prophylactic treatments, and applications in which one reduces the risk that a subject will develop a disorder or other risk factor.",0
Treatment does not require the complete curing of a disorder and encompasses embodiments in which one reduces symptoms or underlying risk factors.,0
"Rather, it denotes that the likelihood of the occurrence of the event has been reduced in the presence of the compound or method.",0
"Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection).",0
Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein.,0

"The structure of the PCSK9 protein has recently been solved by two groups (Cunningham et al., Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2007, and Piper et al., Structure, 15:1-8, 2007), the entireties of both of which are herein incorporated by reference.",0
"In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins provided are polypeptides which comprise one or more complementary determining regions (CDRs), as described herein.",0
"In some antigen binding proteins, the CDRs are embedded into a “framework” region, which orients the CDR(s) such that the proper antigen binding properties of the CDR(s) is achieved.",0
"In some embodiments, antigen binding proteins provided herein can interfere with, block, reduce or modulate the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR.",0
"Such antigen binding proteins are denoted as “neutralizing.” In some embodiments, binding between PCSK9 and LDLR can still occur, even though the antigen binding protein is neutralizing and bound to PCSK9.",0
"For example, in some embodiments, the ABP prevents or reduces the adverse influence of PCSK9 on LDLR without blocking the LDLR binding site on PCSK9.",0
"Thus, in some embodiments, the ABP modulates or alters PCSK9's ability to result in the degradation of LDLR, without having to prevent the binding interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR.",0
"In some embodiments, the neutralizing ABP binds to PCSK9 in a location and/or manner that prevents PCSK9 from binding to LDLR.",0
"Both of the above neutralizers can result in a greater amount of free LDLR being present in a subject, which results in more LDLR binding to LDL (thereby reducing the amount of LDL in the subject).",0

"In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds to the substrate-binding groove of PCSK-9 (described in Cunningham et al., incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).",0
"In some embodiments, the domain(s)/region(s) containing residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in PCSK9 (e.g., a wild-type antigen) and determining whether the antigen binding protein can bind the mutated or variant PCSK9 protein.",0
"By making a number of individual mutations, residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can be identified.",0
"From a knowledge of these amino acids, the domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen that contain residues in contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the antibody can be elucidated.",0
"One specific example of this general approach utilizes an arginine/glutamic acid scanning protocol (see, e.g., Nanevicz, T., et al., 1995,  J. Biol.",0
"In general, arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically individually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced.",0
A variety of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect binding.,0
Example 39 describes one such arginine/glutamic acid scanning of PCSK9 for PCSK9 antigen binding proteins provided herein.,0
Binding of each mutant PCSK9 antigen with various PCSK9 ABPs was measured and compared to the ability of the selected ABPs to bind wild-type PCSK9 (SEQ ID NO: 303).,0
"An alteration (for example a reduction or increase) in binding between an antigen binding protein and a variant PCSK9 as used herein means that there is a change in binding affinity (e.g., as measured by known methods such as Biacore testing or the bead based assay described below in the examples), EC 50 , and/or a change (for example a reduction) in the total binding capacity of the antigen binding protein (for example, as evidenced by a decrease in Bmax in a plot of antigen binding protein concentration versus antigen concentration).",0

"Finally, 40 μl/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 μl/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature.",0
Mouse Cross-Reactivity Screen The panel of hybridomas was then screened for cross-reactivity to mouse PCSK9 to make certain that the antibodies could bind to both human and mouse PCSK9.,0
The following protocol was employed in the cross-reactivity screen: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed.,0

The mutant was used for this assay because it has a higher binding affinity to LDLR allowing a more sensitive receptor ligand blocking assay to be developed.,0
The following protocol was employed in the receptor ligand blocking screen: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the screen.,0
"The capture sample was LDLR (R&D, Cat #2148LD/CF), and was added at 0.4 μg/ml in 1×PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca 2+  at a volume of 40 μl/well.",0
"Contemporaneously, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated human D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 15 microliters of hybridoma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypropylene plates and the exhaust supernatant concentration was diluted 1:5.",0
"Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. 50 μl/well of the pre-incubated mixture was transferred onto the LDLR coated ELISA plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.",0
"Finally, 40 μl/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 μl/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature.",0
"The screen identified 384 antibodies that blocked the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR well, 100 antibodies blocked the interaction strongly (OD<0.3).",0
Receptor Ligand Binding Assay on Blocker Subset The receptor ligand assay was then repeated using the mutant enzyme on the 384 member subset of neutralizers identified in the first large scale receptor ligand inhibition assay.,0
The same protocol was employed in the screen of the 384 member blocker subset assay as was done in the large scale receptor ligand blocking screen.,0
This screen of the 384 member subset identified 85 antibodies that blocked interaction between the PCSK9 mutant enzyme and the LDLR greater than 90%.,0
Receptor Ligand Binding Assay of Blockers that Bind the Wild Type PCSK9 but not the D374Y Mutant In the initial panel of 3000 sups there were 86 antibodies shown to specifically bind to the wild-type PCSK9 and not to the huPCSK9 (D374Y) mutant.,0
The following protocol was employed: Costar 3702 medium binding 384 well plates (Corning Life Sciences) were employed in the screen.,0
"LDLR (R&D Systems, #2148LD/CF or R&D Systems, #2148LD) was added at 5 μg/ml in 1×PBS/1% milk/10 mM Ca 2+  at a volume of 40 μl/well.",0
"Next, the plates were washed using the Titertek plate washer operated using a 3-cycle wash. Contemporaneously, biotinylated human wild-type PCSK9 was pre-incubated with hybridoma exhaust supernatant in Nunc polypropylene plates.",0
"22 μl of hybridoma sup was transferred into 33 ul of b-PCSK9 at a concentration of 583 ng/ml in 1×PBS/1% milk/10 mMCa2+, giving a final b-PCSK9 concentration=350 ng/ml and the exhaust supernatant at a final dilution of 1:2.5.",0
50 μl/well of the preincubated mixture was transferred onto LDLR captured ELISA plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.,0
"Finally, 40 μl/well of One-step TMB (Neogen, Lexington, Ky.) was added to the plate and was quenched with 40 μl/well of 1N hydrochloric acid after 30 minutes at room temperature.",0
"Screening Results Based on the results of the assays described, several hybridoma lines were identified as producing antibodies with desired interactions with PCSK9.",0
"In general, no difference among the different clones of a particular line were detected by the functional assays described herein.",0
"In a few cases, clones were identified from a particular line that behaved differently in the functional assays, for example, 25A7.1 was found not to block PCSK9/LDLR but 25A7.3 (referred to herein as 25A7) was neutralizing.",0
"The isolated clones were each expanded in 50-100 ml of hybridoma media and allowed to grow to exhaustion, (i.e., less than about 10% cell viability).",0
"The concentration and potency of the antibodies to PCSK9 in the supernatants of those cultures were determined by ELISA and by in vitro functional testing, as described herein.",0
"As a result of the screening described herein, the hybridomas with the highest titer of antibodies to PCSK9 were identified.",0

"To form the PCSK9 and antibody complex, 2 μg/ml of D374Y human PCSK9 was incubated with various concentrations of antibody diluted in uptake buffer (DMEM with 1% FBS) or uptake buffer alone (control) for 1 hour at room temperature.",0
"After washing the cells with PBS, the D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to the cells, followed by LDL-BODIPY (Invitrogen) diluted in uptake buffer at a final concentration of 6 μg/ml.",0

"8D , the percentage change is in relation to total serum cholesterol and HDL levels measured in naïve animals at t=0 hrs (*P<0.01, #P<0.05).",0
"In respect to the lowered HDL levels, it is noted that one of skill in the art will appreciate that the decrease in HDL in mice is not indicative that an HDL decrease will occur in humans and merely further reflects that the serum cholesterol level in the organism has decreased.",0
It is noted that mice transport the majority of serum cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles which is different to humans who carry most serum cholesterol on LDL particles.,0
Mouse HDL contains apolipoprotein E (apoE) which is a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR) and allows it to be cleared by the LDLR.,0
"Thus, examining HDL is an appropriate indicator for the present example, in mice (with the understanding that a decrease in HDL is not expected for humans).",0
"As PCSK9 antibodies increase LDLR expression in mouse, the liver can clear more HDL and therefore lowers serum HDL-C levels.",0
"Example 14 Effect of Antibody 31H4 on LDLR Levels in a 6 Day Study The present example demonstrates that an antigen binding protein alters the level of LDLR in a subject, as predicted, over time.",0

"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the antibodies will lower mouse HDL, this is not expected to occur in humans because of the differences in HDL in humans and other organisms (such as mice).",0
"Example 17 Repeated Administration of Antibodies Produce Continued Benefits of Antigen Binding Peptides In order to verify that the results obtained in the Examples above can be prolonged for further benefits with additional doses, the Experiments in Examples 15 and 16 were repeated with the dosing schedule depicted in  FIG.",0
"11B , while both sets of mice displayed a significant decrease in total serum cholesterol because all of the mice received an initial injection of the 31H4 antigen binding protein, the mice that received additional injections of the 31H4 ABP displayed a continued reduction in total serum cholesterol, while those mice that only received the control injection eventually displayed an increase in their total serum cholesterol.",0
"The results from this example demonstrate that, unlike other cholesterol treatment methods, in which repeated applications lead to a reduction in efficacy because of biological adjustments in the subject, the present approach does not seem to suffer from this issue over the time period examined.",0
"Moreover, this suggests that the return of total serum cholesterol or HDL cholesterol levels to baseline, observed in the previous examples is not due to some resistance to the treatment being developed by the subject, but rather the depletion of the antibody availability in the subject.",0
Example 18 Epitope Mapping of Human Anti PCSK9 Antibodies This example outlines methods for determining which residues in PCSK9 are involved in forming or part of the epitope for the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein to PCSK9.,0
"In order to determine the epitopes to which certain of the ABPs of the present invention bind, the epitopes of the ABPs can be mapped using synthetic peptides derived from the specific PCSK9 peptide sequence.",0
A SPOTs peptide array (Sigma Genosys) can be used to study the molecular interaction of the human anti-PCSK9 antibodies with their peptide epitope.,0
SPOTs technology is based on the solid-phase synthesis of peptides in a format suitable for the systematic analysis of antibody epitopes.,0
"Each consecutive peptide can be offset by 1 residue from the previous one, yielding a nested, overlapping library of arrayed oligopeptides.",0
The binding of the mAbs to the membrane-bound peptides can be assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).,0
"In this process, a combinatorial alanine-scanning strategy can be used to identify amino acids in the PCSK9 protein that are necessary for interaction with anti-PCSK9 ABPs.",0
"In the alternative, given that it is possible that the epitope is conformational, a combination of alanine scanning and/or arginine scanning, antibody FAB/PCSK9 co-crystallization, and limited proteolysis/LC-MS (liquid chromatography mass spec.)",0
"Example 19 Uses of PCSK9 Antibodies for the Treatment of Cholesterol Related Disorders A human patient exhibiting a Cholesterol Related Disorder (in which a reduction in cholesterol (such as serum cholesterol) can be beneficial) is administered a therapeutically effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12).",0
"At periodic times during the treatment, the patient is monitored to determine whether the symptoms of the disorder has subsided.",0
"Following treatment, it is found that patients undergoing treatment with the PCSK9 antibody have reduced serum cholesterol levels, in comparison to patients that are not treated.",0
"Example 20 Uses of PCSK9 Antibodies for the Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia A human patient exhibiting symptoms of hypercholesterolemia is administered a therapeutically effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, such as 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12).",0

"The patient is administered a therapeutically effective amount of PCSK9 antibody, such as 31H4 (or, for example, 21B12 or 16F12), either alone, concurrently or sequentially with a statin, e.g., simvastatin.",0
"At periodic times during the treatment, the human patient is monitored to determine whether the patient's total serum cholesterol level changes.",0
"Throughout the preventative treatment, it is found that the patient receiving the treatment with the PCSK9 antibodies has reduced serum cholesterol thereby reducing their risk to coronary heart diseases or recurrent cardiovascular events in comparison to patients not receiving the treatment.",0
Example 22 Use of PCSK9 Antibodies as a Diagnostic Agent An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of PCSK9 antigen in a sample can used to diagnose patients exhibiting high levels of PCSK9 production.,0
"In the assay, wells of a microtiter plate, such as a 96-well microtiter plate or a 384-well microtiter plate, are adsorbed for several hours with a first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against PCSK9.",0
The wells are rinsed and treated with a blocking agent such as milk protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.,0
"Subsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing the PCSK9, or with a solution containing a standard amount of the antigen.",0
"Such a sample may be, for example, a serum sample from a subject suspected of having levels of circulating antigen considered to be diagnostic of a pathology.",0
"After rinsing away the test sample or standard, the wells are treated with a second fully human monoclonal PCSK9 antibody that is labeled by conjugation with biotin.",0
"After rinsing away excess second antibody, the wells are treated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a suitable chromogenic substrate.",0
The concentration of the antigen in the test samples is determined by comparison with a standard curve developed from the standard samples.,0
This ELISA assay provides a highly specific and very sensitive assay for the detection of the PCSK9 antigen in a test sample.,0
"The ELISA is performed as follows: 50 μL of capture PCSK9 antibody in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO 3 , pH 9.6) at a concentration of 2 μg/mL is coated on ELISA plates (Fisher).",0
"After incubation at 4° C. overnight, the plates are treated with 200 μL of blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in PBS) for 1 hour at 25° C. The plates are washed (3×) using 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (washing buffer, WB).",0
"The plates are incubated with serum samples overnight at 4° C., washed with WB, and then incubated with 100 μL/well of biotinylated detection PCSK9 antibody for 1 hour at 25° C. After washing, the plates are incubated with HRP-Streptavidin for 15 minutes, washed as before, and then treated with 100 μL/well of o-phenylenediamine in H 2 O 2  (Sigma developing solution) for color generation.",0
Concentration of PCSK9 antigen in serum samples is calculated by comparison to dilutions of purified PCSK9 antigen using a four parameter curve fitting program.,0
Determination of PCSK9 Variant Protein Concentration in Subjects The steps outlined above can be performed using antibodies noted herein that bind to both the wild type PCSK9 and the variant PCSK9 (D374Y).,0
"Next, antibodies that bind to the wild type but not the mutant can be used (again using a similar protocol as outlined above) to determine if the PCSK9 present in the subject is wild type or the D374Y variant.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, results that are positive for both rounds will be wild-type, while those that are positive for the first round, but not the second round of antibodies, will include the D374Y mutation.",0
There are high frequency mutations in the population that are known and the could benefit particularly from an agent such as the ABPs disclosed herein.,0
"Example 23 Use of PCSK9 Antigen Binding Protein for the Prevention of Hypercholesterolemia A human patient exhibiting a risk of developing hypercholesterolemia is identified via family history analysis and/or lifestyle, and/or current cholesterol levels.",0

Immunoblots were performed using rabbit anti-human LDL receptor antibody (Fitzgerald) or rabbit anti-human b-actin antibody.,0
Immunoblots were performed using rabbit anti-human LDL receptor antibody (Fitzgerald) or rabbit anti-human b-actin antibody.,0
"12A-12F , increasing amounts of the neutralizing antibody and increasing amounts of the statin generally resulted in increases in the level of LDLR.",0

"12D-12F  to  12 A- 12 C, the influence of the ABP concentrations on LDLR levels increased dramatically when PCSK9 was being produced by the cells.",0
"In addition, it is clear that the neutralizing ABPs (21B12 and 31H4) resulted in a greater increase in LDLR levels, even in the presence of statins, than the 25A7.1 ABP (a non-neutralizer), demonstrating that additional benefits can be achieved by the use of both statins and ABPs to PCSK9.",0
Example 25 Consensus Sequences Consensus sequences were determined using standard phylogenic analyses of the CDRs corresponding to the V H  and V L  of anti-PCSK9 ABPs.,0
The consensus sequences were determined by keeping the CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a V H  or V L .,0
"Briefly, amino acid sequences corresponding to the entire variable domains of either V H  or V L  were converted to FASTA formatting for ease in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylogenies.",0
"Next, framework regions of these sequences were replaced with an artificial linker sequence (“bbbbbbbbbb” placeholders, non-specific nucleic acid construct) so that examination of the CDRs alone could be performed without introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to coincident events (e.g., such as unrelated antibodies that serendipitously share a common germline framework heritage) while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a V H  or V L .",0
"V H  or V L  sequences of this format were then subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClutalW-like algorithm (see, Thompson et al., 1994,  Nucleic Acids Res.",0
"This program likewise generated phylograms (phylogenic tree illustrations) based on sequence similarity alignments using either UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) or Neighbor-Joining methods (see, Saitou and Nei, 1987,  Molecular Biology and Evolution  4:406-425) to construct and illustrate similarity and distinction of sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping.",0
Both methods produced similar results but UPGMA-derived trees were ultimately used as the method employs a simpler and more conservative set of assumptions.,0
"UPGMA-derived trees were generated where similar groups of sequences were defined as having fewer than 15 substitutions per 100 residues (see, legend in tree illustrations for scale) amongst individual sequences within the group and were used to define consensus sequence collections.",0
"13E , the groups were chosen so that sequences in the light chain that clade are also a Glade in the heavy chain and have fewer than 15 substitutions.",0
"13A-13J  present a large amount of guidance as to the importance of particular amino acids (for example, those amino acids that are conserved) and which amino acid positions can likely be altered (for example, those positions that have different amino acids for different ABPs).",0
"Example 26 Mouse Model for PCSK9 and ABP Ability to Lower LDL In Vivo To generate mice which over-expressed human PCSK9, three week old WT C57B1/6 mice were injected via tail vein administration with various concentrations of adenoassociated virus (AAV), recombinantly modified to express human PCSK9, to determine the correct titer which would provide a measurable increase of LDL-cholesterol in the mice.",0
"Using this particular virus that expressed human PCSK9, it was determined that 4.5×10E12 pfu of virus would result in an LDL-cholesterol level of approximately 40 mg/dL in circulating blood (normal levels of LDL in a WT mice are approximately 10 mg/dL).",0
"Animals were then administered, via tail vein injection, a single bolus injection of either 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of 16F12, 21B12, or 31H4 antigen binding proteins.",0
"Both 31H4 and 21B12 demonstrated significant LDL-cholesterol lowering up to and including 48 hours post-administration, as compared to IgG2 control (shown in  FIGS.",0
"16F12 shows an intermediary LDL-cholesterol lowering response, with levels returning to baseline of approximately 40 mg/dL by the 48 hour time point.",0
"This data is consistent with in vitro binding data (Biacore and Kinexa), which shows near equivalent binding affinity between 31H4 and 21B12, and a lesser affinity of 16F12 to human PCSK9.",0
"As can be seen in the results, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were reduced by the PCSK9 ABPs in the model (both total and HDL-C are elevated above WT mice due to the overexpression of PCSK9).",0
"While cholesterol lowering in this model appears to occur over a relatively short period of time, this is believed to be due to the levels of human PCSK9 that are present, which are supraphysiologically high in this model.",0
"In these figures, (*) denotes a P<0.05, and (**) denotes a P<0.005 as compared to LDL-cholesterol levels observed in IgG2 control injected animals at the same time point.",0
"The 13 microgram/ml level of serum human PCSK9 in the mice corresponds to an approximately 520-fold increase above the endogenous mouse PCSK9 levels (˜25 ng/ml), and an approximately 75-fold increase above average human serum levels (˜175 ng/ml).",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the above results demonstrate that appropriateness of the mouse model for testing the antigen binding protein's ability to alter serum cholesterol in a subject.",0
"One of skill in the art will also recognize that the use of mouse HDL to monitor serum cholesterol levels in a mouse, while useful for monitoring mouse serum cholesterol levels, is not indicative of the ABPs impact on human HDL in humans.",0
"(“Sequence variations in PCSK9, low LDL, and protection against coronary heart disease”, N Engl J Med, 354:1264-1272, 2006) demonstrated the lack of any effect of the PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations on human HDL levels (the entirety of which is incorporated by reference).",0
"Thus, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the ability of the ABP to lower mouse HDL (which lack LDL) is not indicative of the ABP's ability to lower human HDL.",0
Example 27 31H4 and 21B12 Bind to the ProCat Region of PCSK9 The present example describes one method for determining where various antibodies bind to PCSK9.,0

"Structure  15, 545-52 (2007)) was overlaid onto the PCSK9 ProCat 31-454 from the complex and the structure of the LDLR in its low pH conformation (Rudenko, G. et al.",0
"20D-20F  show the above interaction, along with mesh surface representations of antibody 31H4 and 21B12 from three different angles.",0
"As is clear from the depictions, not only can the antibody interact and/or interfere with LDLR's interaction with PCSK9 at the actual binding site, but other steric interactions appear to occur as well.",0
"In light of the above results, it is clear that antigen binding proteins that bind to PCSK9 can also inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR by clashing with various regions of the LDLR (not just the site at which LDLR and PCSK9 interact).",0
"Embodiments of Antigen Binding Molecules that Bind to or Block EGFa Interaction with PCSK9 As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, Examples 28-32, and their accompanying figures, provide a detailed description of how and where EGFa interacts with PCSK9 and how two representative neutralizing antigen binding proteins, 21B12 and 31H4 interact with PCSK9 and produce their neutralizing effect.",0
"As such, one of skill in the art will readily be able to identify antigen binding molecules that can similarly reduce the binding between EGFa (including LDLR) and PCSK9 by identifying other antigen binding molecules that bind at or near at least one of the same locations on PCSK9.",0

"In some embodiments, antigen binding molecules that bind to the first and/or second sides of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 can be useful as neutralizing antibodies as they can either directly or sterically interfere with EGFa's binding to PCSK9.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, when the antigen binding molecules are large enough, such as a full antibody, the antigen binding molecule need not directly bind to the EGFa binding site in order to interfere with the binding of EGFa to PCSK9.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the EGFa domain of the LDLR has been used in many of the examples, the models and structures are still applicable to how the full length LDLR protein will interact with PCSK9.",0
"Indeed, the additional structure present on the full length LDLR protein presents additional protein space that can further be blocked by one of the antigen binding molecules.",0
"As such, if the antigen binding molecule blocks or inhibits binding of EGFa to PCSK9, it will likely be at least as, if not more, effective with the full length LDLR protein.",0
"Similarly, antigen binding molecules that are within a set distance or block various residues that are relevant for inhibiting EGFa binding, will likely be as effective, if not more effective, for the full length LDLR.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, any molecule that blocks or binds to the above noted PCSK9 residues (or within the recited distances), or that inhibits one or more of the interactions noted in the above examples and figures, can be used to inhibit the interaction of EGFa (or LDLR generally) and PCSK9.",0
"As such, the molecule need not be limited to an antigen binding “protein,” as any antigen binding molecule can also serve the required purpose.",0
"Other examples of antigen binding molecules include avimers, peptibodies, small molecules and polymers, and modified versions of EGFa that can increase its affinity to PCSK9 and/or half-life, such as mutation of amino acids, glycosylation, pegylation, Fc fusions, and avimer fusions.",0

"The PCSK9 proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography.",0
"For the full length N555A variant for crystallography, the PCSK9 31-454 fragment, and the PCSK9 449TEV variant for crystalography, the post rTEV protein product also included an initial GAMG sequence.",0

Analysis of the structure shows where this antibody interacts with PCSK9 and demonstrated that antibodies that do not bind to the LDLR binding surface of PCSK9 can still inhibit the degradation of LDLR that is mediated through PCSK9 (when the results are viewed in combination with Example 40 and 41 below).,0

"For the antibody pair to be considered bound simultaneously, and therefore in different bins, the subtracted signal had to be greater than 3 times the signal of the antibody competing with itself and the 3 times the signal of the antibody competing with the irrelevant antibody.",0

"Thus, the above identified ABPs in each of the binds are representative of different types of epitope locations on PCSK9, some of which overlap with each other.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, if the reference ABP prevents the binding of the probe ABP then the antibodies are said to be in the same bin.",0
If ABP A is employed as the reference ABP and blocks the binding of ABP B the converse is not always true: ABP B used as the reference ABP will not necessarily block ABP A.,0
"There are a number of factors in play here: the binding of an ABP can cause conformational changes in the target which prevent the binding of the second ABP, or epitopes which overlap but do not completely occlude each other may allow for the second ABP to still have enough high-affinity interactions with the target to allow binding.",0
"In general, if competition is observed in either order the ABPs are said to bin together, and if both ABPs can block each other then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely.",0
Example 38 Epitope Mapping Western Blot The present example demonstrates whether or not the epitopes for the examined ABPs were linear or conformational.,0
Denaturing reducing and denaturing non-reducing western blots were run to determine which antibodies have a conformational epitope.,0
"For the blot, 0.5 ug/lane of purified full-length human PCSK9 was run on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and MES SDS Running Buffer.",0
"In addition, 3C4 and 31A4 appeared to bind to conformational epitopes which were preserved by disulfide bonds, as these antibodies bound to PCSK-9 under denaturing conditions where the disulfide bonds had been preserved (left) but reducing the samples (right) eliminated binding.",0
Example 39 Epitope Mapping Arginine/Glutamic Acid Scanning Representative ABPs from each bin (from Example 37) were selected for further epitope analysis.,0
"By way of background, this method determines if a residue is part of the structural epitope, meaning those residues in the antigen which contact or are buried by the antibody.",0
Arginine and glutamic acid sidechains are charged and bulky and can disrupt antibody binding even if the mutated residue is not directly involved in antibody binding.,0
"The PCSK9 structure contained gaps of missing residues and was missing 30 amino acids in the N- (i.e., the signal sequence) and 10 amino acids in the C-termini.",0
The solvent exposure ratio for each residue was calculated: the surface area of each residue in the context of the protein (SA1) was divided by the surface area of the residue in a trimer with flanking glycines (SA2) with a conserved backbone structure.,0
The number of residues to be mutated in the V domain was reduced by using a solvent exposure ratio of 37% along with visual inspection of the entire protein to bring the total number of mutations to 285.,0
"All PCSK9 constructs were expressed in transiently-transfected 293-6E cells in 24-well plates and re-racked into three 96-well plates with a non-mutated PCSK9 control (wild-type, WT) in each plate.",0
An alignment of the PCSK9 parent sequence and a representative PCSK9 sequence with the 244 mutated residues is shown in  FIG.,0
"For the purposes of the epitope sequences and the epitope based inventions involving changes in binding, the sequences are provided in reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: 303.",0
"One of skill in the art will appreciate that the present results apply to other PCSK9 variants disclosed herein as well (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 and 3, as well as the other allelic variants).",0
Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction (e.g.,0
"These two sidechains were chosen due to their large steric bulk and their charge, which allows mutations that occur in the structural epitope to have a greater effect on antibody binding.",0
"Arginine was generally employed except when the WT reside was arginine, and in these cases the residue was mutated to glutamic acid to switch the charge.",0
"For the purpose of epitope mapping, a bead-based multiplexed assay was used to measure antibody binding to PCSK9 and PCSK9 mutants simultaneously.",0
The variants were split into three groups: Group 1: 81 variants+2 wt controls+1 negative control+1 other PCSK9 supernatant; Group 2: 81 variants+2 wt controls+2 negative controls; and Group 3: 82 variants+2 wt control+1 negative control.,0
"The assay was run as follows: 85 sets of color-coded strepavidin-coated LumAvidin beads (Luminex) were bound with biotinylated anti-pentaHis antibody (Qiagen, #1019225) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) then washed three times in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20.",0
"Each color-coded bead set was then allowed to bind to a PCSK9 mutant, wild-type, or negative control in 150 ul supernatant overnight at 4° C. The color-coded bead sets, each associated to a specific protein, were washed and pooled.",0
100 ul of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in 4-fold dilutions were added to nine columns for triplicate points and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed.,0
"100 ul of 1:200 dilution phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson Immunoresearch, #109-116-170) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed.",0
The instrument identifies each bead by its color-code thereby identifying the specific protein associated with the color code.,0

"Therefore, the difference between beads regions was due to purely B-B variance and was not confounded by difference between wild type and mutant proteins.",0
The estimated B-B standard deviation (SD) was then used to build the EC50 confidence intervals of wild type and mutant proteins during curve comparison experiments.,0
"The resulting file, containing curve quality control (QC) results and parameter estimates for top (max), bottom (min), Hillslope (slope), and natural log of EC50 (xmid) of the curves, was used as the raw data for the analysis.",0

Identifying Residues in the Structural Epitope A residue was considered part of the structural epitope (a “hit”) when mutating it to arginine or glutamic acid alters antibody binding.,0
Statistical analyses of antibody binding curves to wild type and mutants were used to identify statistically significant EC50 shifts.,0
"Hit Identification based on EC50 Comparison The EC50 and Bmax values were generated from a Weighted 4-Parameter Logistical model fitted to the binding data using S-PLUS with VarPower software (Insightful Corporation, Seattle Wash.).",0
"The Variations in EC50 Estimates Two sources of variations were considered in the comparison of EC50 estimates, variation from the curve fit and the bead-bead variation.",0
"Wild types and mutants were linked to different beads, hence their difference are confounded with the bead-bead difference (described above).",0
Bead-bead variation was experimentally determined using an experiment where wild type controls were linked to each one of the beads (described above).,0
The bead variation in EC50 estimates of wild type binding curve from this experiment was used to estimate the bead-bead variation in the actual epitope mapping experiment.,0
Testing for EC50 Shift Between Mutants and Wild Type The comparisons of two EC50s (in log scale) was conducted using Student's t-test.,0
The t-statistic was calculated as the ratio between delta (the absolute differences between EC50 estimates) and the standard deviation of delta.,0
"The variance of delta was estimated by the sum of the three components, variance estimate of EC50 for mutant and wild type curves in the nonlinear regression and two times the bead-bead variance estimated from a separate experiment.",0
The multiple of two for the bead-bead variance was due to the assumption that both mutant and wild type beads had the same variance.,0
Individual p-values and confidence intervals (95% and 99%) were derived based on Student's t distribution for each comparison.,0
"In the case of multiple wild type controls, a conservative approach was taken by picking the wild type control that was most similar to the mutant, i.e., picking the ones with the largest p-values.",0
Multiplicity adjustments were important to control the false positive(s) while conducting a large number of tests simultaneously.,0
Two forms of multiplicity adjustment were implemented for this analysis: family wise error (FWE) control and false discovery rate (FDR) control.,0
The FWE approach controls the probability that one or more hits are not real; FDR approach controls the expected proportion of false positive among the selected hits.,0
"There are many methods available for both approaches, for this analysis, the Hochberg's (1988) method for FWE analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg's (1995) FDR method for FDR analysis were selected.",0
"Results EC50 Shift Mutations whose EC50 is significantly different from wild type, e.g., having a False Discovery Rate adjusted p-value for the whole assay of 0.01 or less, were considered part of the structural epitope.",0
All the hits also had a Familywise type I error rate adjusted p-value for each antibody of less than 0.01 except residue R185E for antibody 31H4 which had an FWE adjusted p-value per antibody of 0.0109.,0
The residues in the structural epitope of the various antibodies determined by EC50 shift are shown in Table 39.3 (point mutations are with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1 and 303) TABLE 39.3 FDR.,0

"While there were approximately a dozen mutants that could have been expected to have an effect on binding (based upon the crystal structure), the present experiment demonstrated that, surprisingly, they did not.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the results presented above are in good agreement with the crystal structures and PCSK-9's binding of these antibodies.",0
This demonstrates that the provided structural and corresponding functional data adequately identifies the key residues and areas of interaction of the neutralizing ABPs and PCSK9.,0
"Thus, variants of the ABPs that possess the ability to bind to the above noted areas are adequately provided by the present description.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while the B-max drop and EC50 shift hits can be considered manifestations of the same phenomenon, strictly speaking, a B-max drop alone does not reflect a loss of affinity per se but, rather, the destruction of some percentage of the epitope of an antibody.",0
"Although there is no overlap in the hits determined by B-max and EC50, mutations with a strong affect on binding may not allow for the generation of a useful binding curve and hence, no EC50 can be determined for such variants.",0
"As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, ABPs in the same bin (with the exception of bin 5, which as noted above, is a general catch all bin) likely bind to overlapping sites on the target protein.",0
"To further examine the above results in regard to ABP 31H4, position E181R, which, according to the above crystal structure, was predicted to interact with R185 to form part of the surface that interacts with the ABP, was also altered (E181R).",0
"The results, while not statistically significant on their own, were, when combined with the crystal structure, demonstrative of 31H4 interacting with E181R (data not shown).",0
"As noted above, the above binding data and epitope characterization references a PCSK9 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) that does not include the first 30 amino acids of PCSK9.",0
"Thus, the numbering system of this protein fragment, and the SEQ ID NO:s that refer to this fragment, are shifted by 30 amino acids compared to the data and experiments that used a full length PCSK9 numbering system (such as that used in the crystal study data described above).",0
"Thus, to compare these results, an extra 30 amino acids should be added to the positions in each of the above epitope mapping results.",0

"Clear, 96 well maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with 2 ug/ml of various anti-PCSK9 antibodies diluted in PBS.",0
"After washing, plates were incubated for two hours with either full length PCSK9 (aa 31-692 SEQ ID NO: 3, procat PCSK9 (aa 31-449 SEQ ID NO: 3) or v-domain PCSK9 (aa 450-692 of SEQ ID NO: 3) diluted in general assay diluent (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC).",0
"Plates were washed and a rabbit polyclonal biotinylated anti-PCSK9 antibody (D8774), which recognizes the procat and v-domain as well as full-length PCSK9, was added at 1 ug/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS).",0
"Bound full-length, procat or v-domain PCSK9 was detected by incubation with neutravidin-HRP (Thermo Scientific) at 200 ng/ml (in 1% BSA/PBS) followed by TMB substrate (KPL) and absorbance measurement at 650 nm.",0
"Example 41 Neutralizing, Non-Competitive Antigen Binding Proteins The present example demonstrates how to identify and characterize an antigen binding protein that is non-competitive with LDLR for binding with PCSK9, but is still neutralizing towards PCSK9 activity.",0
"In other words, such an antigen binding protein will not block PCSK9 from binding to LDLR, but will prevent or reduce PCSK9 mediated LDLR degradation.",0
"Clear, 384 well plates (Costar) were coated with 2 ug/ml of goat anti-LDL receptor antibody (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer A (100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4).",0
"After washing, plates were incubated for 1.5 hours with 0.4 ug/ml of LDL receptor (R&D Systems) diluted in buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 10 mM CaCl 2 ).",0
"Concurrent with this incubation, 20 ng/ml of biotinylated D374Y PCSK9 was incubated with 100 ng/ml of antibody diluted in buffer A or buffer A alone (control).",0
The LDL receptor containing plates were washed and the biotinylated D374Y PCSK9/antibody mixture was transferred to them and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.,0
Binding of the biotinylated D374Y to the LDL receptor was detected by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Biosource) at 500 ng/ml in buffer C followed by TMB substrate (KPL).,0
"28A and 28B , it is clear that 31A4 ABP binds to the V domain of PCSK9 and does not block the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR.",0
"Next, the Ability of ABP 31A4 to serve as a neutralizing ABP was further confirmed via a cell LDL uptake assay (as described in the examples above).",0
"Thus, in light of Example 40 and the present results, it is clear that ABPs can bind to PCSK9 without blocking the PCSK9 and LDLR binding interaction, while still being useful as neutralizing PCSK9 ABPs.",0

"REFERENCE TO SEQUENCE LISTING 
[0002] This application is being filed electronically via 
EFS-Web and includes an electronically submitted sequence 
listing in .",0
"FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
[0003] The present invention relates to antibodies, e. g. , full 
length antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof, pep- 
tides, and aptamers that antagonize the activity of extracellu- 
lar proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), 
including its interaction with the low density lipoprotein 
(LDL) receptor (LDLR).",0
"More specifically, the invention 
relates to compositions comprising antagonist PCSK9 anti- 
bodies, peptides, and/or aptamers and methods of using these 
antibodies and/or peptides and/or aptamers as a medicament.",0
"The antagonist PCSK9 antibodies, peptides, and aptamers 
can be used therapeutically to lower LDL-cholesterol levels 
in blood, and can be used in the prevention and/or treatment of 
cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism disorders, including 
familial hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, 
atherosclerosis, and, more generally, cardiovascular disease 
(CVD).",0
"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
[0004] Millions of people in the U. S. are at risk for heart 
disease and resulting cardiac events.",0
"CVD and underlying 
atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death among all demo- 
graphic groups, despite the availability of therapies directed 
at its multiple risk factors.",0
"Atherosclerosis is a disease of the 
arteries and is responsible for coronary heart disease associ- 
ated with many deaths in industrialized countries.",0
"Several risk 
factors for coronary heart disease have now been identified: 
dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor diet, 
inactivity and stress.",0
"The most clinically relevant and com- 
mon dyslipidemias are characterized by an increase in beta- 
lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL) 
with hypercholesterolemia in the absence or presence of 
hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrlckson et al.",0
"There is 
a long-felt significant unmet need with respect to CVD with 
60-70% of cardiovascular events, heart attacks and strokes 
occurring despite the treatment with statins (the current stan- 
dard of care in atherosclerosis).",0
"Moreover, new guidelines 
suggest that even lower LDL levels should be achieved in 
order to protect high risk patients from premature CVD [Na- 
tional Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2004].",0
"[0005] PCSK9, also known as NARC-1, was identified as a 
protein with a genetic mutation in some forms of familial 
hypercholesterolemia.",0
"PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen 
that undergoes autocatalytic processing at the motif LVFAQ 
in the endoplasmic reticulum.",0
"Population studies have shown 
that some PCSK9 mutations are ""gain-of-function"" and are 
found in individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholes- 
terolemia, while other ""loss-of-function"" (LOF) mutations 
are linked with reduced plasma cholesterol.",0
"Morbidity and 
mortality studies in this group clearly demonstrated that 
reducing PCSK9 function significantly diminished the risk of 
cardiovascular disease.",0
"[0006] Of significant importance to the treatment of CVD, 
a LOF mutation may sensitize humans to statins, allowing for 
efficacy at a lower dose (hence, improving risks associated 
with safety and tolerance) and potentially achieving lower 
plasma cholesterol levels than with current therapies.",0
"Genetic modulation of PCSK9 in mice con- 
firmed the ability of PCSK9 to regulate blood lipids, and 
suggested that it acts to down-regulate hepatic LDLR protein 
levels.",0
"[0008] The mechanism by which, and the site at which, 
PCSK9 down-regulates LDLR protein has not been clearly 
established.",0
"There is strong evidence that extracellular PCSK9 binds to 
cell surface LDLR and promotes LDLR degradation at an 
intracellular site.",0
"However, it is also possible that PCSK9 
could interact with the LDLR when the two proteins are 
translated within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic 
through endosomal compartments towards the cell mem- 
brane.",0
"16:167-172, 
showed that PCSK9-mediated LDLR endocytosis and degra- 
dation was not altered by proteosome inhibitors nor was it 
modulated by different classes of lysosomal and nonlysoso- 
mal proteases.",0
"Two naturally occurring familial hypercholes- 
terolemia mutations, S127R and D129G, have been reported 
to be defective in autoprocessing and secretion as levels of 
these mutant proteins were greatly reduced or undetectable in 
the media of transfected cells.",0
"Yet these mutants demon- 
strated an enhanced ability to down-regulate LDLR, consis- 
tent with their identification in individuals with high plasma 
LDL (Horner et al.",0
"Since these mutants apparently do not 
get secreted extracellularly, and yet do downregulate LDLR, 
this strongly suggests that an intracellular site of action is 
physiologically important.",0
"[0009] From the information available in the art, and prior 
to the present invention, it remained unclear whether the

[0058] The practice of the present invention will employ, 
unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of 
molecular biology (including recombinant techniques),

"DEFINITIONS 
[0059] An ""antibody"" is an immunoglobulin molecule 
capable of specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, 
polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc.",0
"As used herein, the term encom- 
passes not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, 
but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')~, Fv), 
single chain (ScFv) and domain antibodies), and fusion pro- 
teins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified 
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that com- 
prises an antigen recognition site.",0
"An antibody includes an 
antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class 
thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class.",0
"Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the con- 
stant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be 
assigned to different classes.",0
"There are five major classes of 
immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several 
of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), 
e. g. , IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAI and IgA2.",0
"The heavy- 
chain constant domains that correspond to the different 
classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, 
gamma, and mu, respectively.",0
"[0060] As used herein, ""monoclonal antibody"" refers to an 
antibody obtained from a population of substantially homo- 
geneous antibodies, i. e. , the individual antibodies comprising 
the population are identical except for possible naturally- 
occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts.",0
"Furthermore, in contrast to 
polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include 
different antibodies directed against different determinants 
(epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a 
single determinant on the antigen.",0
"The modifier ""mono- 
clonal"" indicates the character of the antibody as being 
obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of 
antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production 
of the antibody by any particular method.",0
"For example, the 
monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the 
present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first 
described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495, or 
may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as 
described in U. S. Pat.",0
"The monoclonal anti- 
bodies may also be isolated from phage libraries generated 
using the techniques described in McCafferty et al.",0
"18, 2010 
[0061] As used herein, ""humanized"" antibody refers to 
forms of non-human (e. g. , murine) antibodies that are chi- 
meric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or frag- 
ments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')~ or other antigen- 
binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal 
sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin.",0
"Prefer- 
ably, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (re- 
cipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary 
determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by 
residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor anti- 
body) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired speci- 
ficity, affinity, and capacity.",0
"In some instances, Fv framework 
region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are 
replaced by corresponding non-human residues.",0
"Further- 
more, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are 
found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported 
CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further 
refine and optimize antibody performance.",0
"In general, the 
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least 
one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or 
substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a 
non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the 
FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus 
sequence.",0
"The humanized antibody optimally also will com- 
prise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region 
or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.",0
"Other forms of humanized anti- 
bodies have one or more CDRs (CDR Ll, CDR L2, CDR L3, 
CDR Hl, CDR H2, and/or CDR H3) which are altered with 
respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or 
more CDRs ""derived from"" one or more CDRs from the 
original antibody.",0
"[0062] As used herein, ""human antibody"" means an anti- 
body having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of 
an antibody that can be produced by a human and/or which 
has been made using any of the techniques for making human 
antibodies known to those skilled in the art or disclosed 
herein.",0
"This definition of a human antibody includes antibod- 
ies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or 
at least one human light chain polypeptide.",0
"In one 
embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage 
library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies 
(Vaughan et al.",0
"Human antibodies 
can also be made by immunization of animals into which 
human immunoglobulin loci have been transgenically intro- 
duced in place of the endogenous loci, e. g. , mice in which the 
endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or 
completely inactivated.",0
"Alternatively, the human antibody may 
be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that 
produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B 
lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may 
have been immunized in vitro).",0
"[0063] A ""variable region"" of an antibody refers to the 
variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable 
region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combi- 
nation.",0
"As known in the art, the variable regions of the heavy 
and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) 
connected by three complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs) that contain hypervariable regions.",0
"The CDRs in each 
chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, 
with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the forma- 
tion of the antigen-binding site of antibodies.",0
"There are at 
least two techniques for determining CDRs: (I) an approach 
based on cross-species sequence variability (ke.",0
")); and (2) 
an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen- 
antibody complexes (Al-Iazikani et al, 1997, J. Molec.",0
"[0064] As known in the art a ""constant region"" of an anti- 
body refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain 
or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either 
alone or in combination.",0
"[0065] As used herein, the term ""PCSK9"" refers to any 
form of PCSK9 and variants thereof that retain at least part of 
the activity of PCSK9.",0
"Unless indicated differently, such as 
by specific reference to human PCSK9, PCSK9 includes all 
mammalian species of native sequence PCSK9, e. g. , human, 
canine, feline, equine, and bovine.",0
"[0066] As used herein, a ""PCSK9 antagonist"" refers to an 
antibody, peptide, or aptamer that is able to inhibit PCSK9 
biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated 
by PCSK9 signaling, including PCSK9-mediated down- 
regulation of the LDLR, and PCSK9-mediated decrease in 
LDL blood clearance.",0
"A PCSK9 antagonist antibody encom- 
passes antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce 
(to any degree including significantly) PCSK9 biological 
activity, including downstream pathways mediated by 
PCSK9 signaling, such as LDLR interaction and/or elicita- 
tion of a cellular response to PCSK9.",0
"For purpose of the 
present invention, it will be explicitly understood that the 
term ""PCSK9 antagonist antibody"" encompasses all the pre- 
viously identified terms, titles, and functional states and char- 
acteristics whereby the PCSK9 itself, a PCSK9 biological 
activity (including but not limited to its ability to mediate any 
aspect of interaction with the LDLR, down regulation of 
LDLR, and decreased blood LDL clearance), or the conse- 
quences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified, 
decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree.",0
"[0067] As used herein a ""full antagonist"" is an antagonist 
which, at an effective concentration, essentially completely 
blocks a measurable effect of PCSK9.",0
"By a partial antagonist 
is meant an antagonist that is capable of partially blocking a 
measurable effect, but that, even at a highest concentration is 
not a full antagonist.",0
"By essentially completely is meant at 
least about 80%, preferably, at least about 90%, more prefer- 
ably, at least about 95%, and most preferably, at least about 
98% or 99% of the measurable effect is blocked.",0
"18, 2010 
regulation of LDLR by a PCSK9 antagonist as assayed in 
Huh7 cells in vitro, in vivo decrease in blood (or plasma) 
levels of total cholesterol, and in vivo decrease in LDL levels 
in blood (or plasma).",0
"[006S] As used herein, the term ""clinically meaningful"" 
means at least a 15% reduction in blood LDL-cholesterol 
levels in humans or at least a 15% reduction in total blood 
cholesterol in mice.",0
"[0069] As used herein, the term ""PCSK9 antagonist pep- 
tide"" or ""PCSK9 antagonist aptamer"" includes any conven- 
tional peptide or polypeptide or aptamer that blocks, antago- 
nizes, suppresses or reduces (to any degree including 
significantly) PCSK9 biological activity, including down- 
stream pathways mediated by PCSK9 signaling, such as 
LDLR interaction and/or elicitation of a cellular response to 
PCSK9.",0
"PCSK9 antagonist peptides or polypeptides include 
Fc fusions comprising the LDLR and soluble portions of the 
LDLR, or mutants thereof with higher affinity to PCSK9.",0
"[0070] The terms ""polypeptide"", ""oligopeptide"", ""peptide"" 
and ""protein"" are used interchangeably herein to refer to 
chains of amino acids of any length, preferably, relatively 
short (e. g. , 10-100 amino acids).",0
"The chain may be linear or 
branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and/or may 
be interrupted by non-amino acids.",0
"The terms also encompass 
an amino acid chain that has been modified naturally or by 
intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glyco- 
sylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any 
other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with 
a labeling component.",0
"Also included within the definition are, 
for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of 
an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino 
acids, etc.",0
"[0071] As known in the art, ""polynucleotide, "" or ""nucleic 
acid, "" as used interchangeably herein, refer to chains o f nucle- 
otides of any length, and include DNA and RNA.",0
"The nucle- 
otides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modi- 
fied nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any 
substrate that can be incorporated into a chain by DNA or 
RNA polymerase.",0
"Other types of modifications include, for 
example, ""caps"", substitution of one or more of the naturally 
occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modi- 
fications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages 
(e. g. , methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoami- 
dates, carbamates, etc. )",0
"), those containing 
pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e. g. , 
nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, 
etc.",0
"Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in 
the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate 
groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting 
groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to addi- 
tional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports.",0
"The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substi- 
tuted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 
I to 20 carbon atoms.",0
"Polynucleotides can also 
contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that 
are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2'-0-
