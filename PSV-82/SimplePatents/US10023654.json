   "Epitope description 1": "We claim: 1. An antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that specifically binds hPCSK9, comprising: a) a heavy chain complementarity determining region 1 (HCDR1) comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 76; b) a heavy chain complementarity determining region 2 (HCDR2) comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 78; c) a heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 80; d) a light chain complementarity determining region 1 (LCDR1) comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 84; e) a light chain complementarity determining region 2 (LCDR2) comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 86; and f) a light chain complementarity determining region 3 (LCDR3) comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 88. 2. The antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of claim 1, wherein the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the antibody binds an epitope comprising amino acid residue 238 of hPCSK9 (SEQ ID NO:755).
