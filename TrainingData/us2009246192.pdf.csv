[0044] The present invention relates to antagonists of 
PCSK9 and, in particular embodiments, those antagonists 
that inhibit both human and murine PCSK9 and those that 
preferentially target processed PCSK9.;[noData]

Protein-specific 
antagonists of PCSK9 (or "PCSK9-specific antagonists") in 
accordance herewith are effective in the selective binding to 
and inhibition of PCSK9 function and, thus, are of import in 
the treatment of conditions associated with or impacted by 
PCSK9 function, including, but not limited to, hypercholes- 
terolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute 
coronary syndrome and related conditions.;[noData]

Use of the term 
"antagonist" refers to the fact that the subject molecule can 
antagonize the functioning of PCSK9.;[noData]

Use of the term 
"antagonizing" or derivatives thereof refers to the act of 
opposing, counteracting, inhibiting, neutralizing or curtailing 
one or more functions of PCSK9.;[noData]

Reference herein to PCSK9 
function or PCSK9 activity refers to any function or activity 
that is driven by, requires, or is exacerbated or enhanced by 
PCSK9.;[noData]

PCSK9-specific antagonists as described herein 
have proven to be effective for counteracting human and/or 
murine PCS K9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake.;[noData]

[0045] One important embodiment hereof relates to I D05 
antibody molecules.;[noData]

Such I D05 antibody molecules are char- 
acterized as comprising a (I) heavy chain variable region 
("VH") comprising SEQ ID NO: 11;;[noData]

and (ii) a light chain 
variable region ("VL") comprising SEQ ID NO: 27.;[noData]

Said VH 
and VL regions comprise the full complement of disclosed 
CDRs I, 2 and 3 for the VH (SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15 and 17) and 
VL regions (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5 and 7), respectively.;[noData]

Examples 
of ID05 antibody molecules include without limitation: (I) a 
Fab which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID NO: I 
and an Fd chain comprising amino acids 1-233 of SEQ ID 
NO: 9 (or SEQ ID NO: 9);;[noData]

and (ii) a full length antibody 
molecule which comprises a light chain comprising SEQ ID 
NO: 26 and a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NO: 25.;[noData]

The 
select group of ID05 antibodies demonstrate that PCSK9- 
specific antagonists as disclosed herein effectively inhibit 
both human and murine PCSK9 and may be studied pharma- 
cologically in murine models absent the expression of human 
PCSK9.;[noData]

[0046] The CDR definitions arrived at and disclosed herein 
were defined using the Morphosys software program 
Sequence Analysis Software ("SAS").;[noData]

Applicants wish to 
note, however, that various other methods are available to 
delineate and define the start and end points of the CDR 
sequences, including but not limited to Kabat, 1991

While the current inventors have employed the 
SAS software to define the CDRs, the present invention fully 
encompasses the different definitions around the sequences 
and the varying CDR delineations arrived at through use of 
any different analysis software or methods.;[noData]

PCSK9-specific 
molecule also have utility forvari- 
ous diagnostic purposes in the detection and quantification of 
PCSK9.;[noData]

[0048] Disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists are, further- 
more, unique in that select embodiments have demonstrated a 
preferential recognition of processed PCSK9, the active form 
of PCSK9.;[noData]

[0049] PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein are 
desirable molecules for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol 
levels and are of utility for any primate, mammal or vertebrate 
of commercial or domestic veterinary importance.;[noData]

PCSK9- 
specific antagonists are of utility as well to inhibit the activity 
of PCSK9 in any population of cells or tissues possessing the 
LDL receptor.;[noData]

The utility of the disclosed antagonists is 
directly measurable by assays readily available to the skilled 
artisan.;[noData]

The particular 
impact of the disclosed antagonists on cellular LDL uptake 
may also be measured through a method which comprises 
providing purified PCSK9 and labeled LDL particles to a cell 
sample;;[noData]

Antagonists that result in an increase in 
the amount of quantified label are PCSK9 antagonists.;[noData]

[0050] Any type of cell bearing the LDL receptor can be 
employed in the above methods including, but not limited to 
HEK cells, HepG2 cells, and CHO cells.;[noData]

LDL particles 
derived from any source are of use in the above-described 
assays.;[noData]

In particular assays, the LDL particles are fresh par- 
ticles derived from blood.;[noData]

This can be accomplished by any 
method available to the skilled artisan including, but not 
limited to, the method of Havel et al.;[noData]

The LDL particles may be labeled with fluores- 
cence.;[noData]

The labeled LDL particles may have incorporated 
therein visible wavelength excited fluorophore 3, 3'-dioctade- 
cylindocarbocyanine iodide (dil(3)) to form the highly fluo- 
rescent LDL derivative dil(3)-LDL.;[noData]

Any label which enables 
the skilled artisan to detect LDL in the cellular lysate may be 
used.;[noData]

An LDL analog may be used that would only become 
detectable (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, become fluorescent or fluoresce at a different 
wavelength, etc.;[noData]

) when metabolized intracellularly or, for 
instance, if it were to become associated with (or dissociated 
from) other molecules in the process of becoming internal- 
ized (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

a FRET assay, in which an LDL analog would 
become associated with a secondary fluor, or else be dissoci- 
ated from a quencher).;[noData]

Any means available in the art for 
detecting internalization of labeled LDL particles can be 
employed.;[noData]

The incubation time for the LDL particles and 
PCSK9 with the cells is an amount of time sufficient to allow 
LDL particle uptake by the cells.;[noData]

This time may be within the 
range of 5 minutes to 360 minutes.;[noData]

The concentration of 
PCSK9 added to the cells may be in the range of I nM to 5 pM 
and, in specific methods, be in the range of 0.;[noData]

1 nM to 3 pM.;[noData]

One specific means by which the skilled artisan can deter- 
mine a range of concentrations for a particular PCSK9 protein 
is to develop a dose response curve in the LDL-uptake assay.;[noData]

A concentration of PCSK9 can be selected that promotes 
close to maximal loss of LDL-uptake and is still in the linear 
range of the dose response curve.;[noData]

Typically, this concentra- 
tion is -5 times the EC-50 of the protein extracted from the 
dose response curve.;[noData]

The concentrations can vary by protein.;[noData]

[0051] Broadly, PCSK9-specific antagonists as defined 
herein selectively recognize and specifically bind to PCSK9.;[noData]

An antibody is typically said to specifically bind an antigen 
when the dissociation constant is ~1 pM, preferably ~100 
nM and most preferably ~10 nM.;[noData]

Use of the terms "selec- 
tive" or "specific" herein, further, refers to the fact that the 
disclosed antagonists do not show significant binding to pro- 
teins other than PSCK9, except in those specific instances 
where the antagonist is supplemented or designed to confer 
an additional, distinct specificity to the PCSK9-specific bind- 
ing portion (as, for example, in bispecific or bifunctional 
molecules where the molecule is designed to bind two mol- 
ecules or effect two functions, at least one of which is to 
specifically bind PCSK9).;[noData]

In specific embodiments, PCSK9- 
specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine PCSK9 
with a Ko of 1.;[noData]

2x10 M or less.;[noData]

In more specific embodi- 
ments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or 
murine PCSK9 with a Ko of Sx10 M or less, of 2x10 M or 
less, or of Ix10 M or less.;[noData]

In additional embodiments, 
PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or murine 
PCSK9 with a Ko of Ix10 M or less.;[noData]

In further embodi- 
ments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human and/or 
murine PCSK9 with a Ko of Sx10 M or less, or of I x10 M 
or less.;[noData]

In select embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists 
bindtohumanand/ormurinePCSK9withaKooflx10 ' M 
orless, a Kooflx10 "Morless, ora Koof lx10 ' M or 
less.;[noData]

In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists 
do not bind proteins other than PCSK9 at the above Kos.;[noData]

Ko 
refers to the dissociation constant obtained from the ratio of 
Ku (the dissociation rate of a particular binding molecule- 
target protein interaction) to K (the association rate of the 
particular binding molecule-target protein interaction), or 
Ku/K which is expressed as a molar concentration (M).;[noData]

Ko 
values can be determined using methods well established in 
the art.;[noData]

A preferred method for determining the Ko of a 
binding molecule is by using surface plasmon resonance, for 
example employing a biosensor system such as a Biacore™ 
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) system.;[noData]

[0052] PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed herein have 
been shown to dose-dependently inhibit human and/or 
murine PCSK9 dependent effects on LDL uptake.;[noData]

Accord- 
ingly, PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein are 
characterized by their ability to counteract PCSK9-dependent 
inhibition of LDL uptake into cells.;[noData]

This uptake of LDL into 
cells by the LDL receptor is referred to herein as "cellular 
LDL uptake".;[noData]

In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific 
antagonists counteract or antagonize human and/or murine 
PCS K9-dependent inhibition o f LDL uptake into cells, exhib- 
iting an ICso of less than 1.;[noData]

0x10 M, or, in order of prefer- 
ence, less than lx10 M, Ix10 M, Ix10 M, Ix10 ' M, 
Ix10 " M and Ix10 ' M.;[noData]

The extent of inhibition by any 
PCSK9-specific antagonist may be measured quantitatively 
in statistical comparison to a control, or via any alternative 
method available in the art for assessing a negative effect on, 
or inhibition of, PCSK9 function (he.;[noData]

, any method capable of 
assessing antagonism of PCSK9 function).;[noData]

In specific 
embodiments, the inhibition is at least about 10% inhibition.;[noData]

In other embodiments, the inhibition is at least 20%, 30%, 
40%, 50%, 60%, 70, %, 80%, 90%, or 95%.;[noData]

Accordingly, 
PCSK9-specific antagonists capable of effecting these levels 
of inhibition of PCSK9 function form particular embodi- 
ments hereo f.;[noData]

[0053] A PCSK9-specific antagonist in accordance here- 
with can be any binding molecule that specifically binds 
human and/or murine PCSK9 protein including, but not lim- 
ited to, antibody molecules as defined below, any PCSK9- 
specific binding structure, any polypeptide or nucleic acid 
structure that specifically binds PCSK9, and any of the fore- 
going incorporated into various protein scaffolds;;[noData]

including 
but not limited to, various non-antibody-based scaffolds, and 
various structures capable of affording or allowing for selec- 
tive binding to PCSK9 including but not limited to small

[0054] Importantly, the binding site (or epitope) for I D05 
on PCSK9 was identified through limited proteolysis and 
mass spectrometry ("LP-MS").;[noData]

The limited proteolysis mass 
spectrometry analysis involved incubating wild-type PCSK9 
("wt-PCSK9") and a complex of wt-PCSK9 and I D05 with 
endoproteinase enzymes of different specificity in carefully 
controlled conditions.;[noData]

Under such conditions, the endopro- 
teases cleaved only exposed primary cleavage sites.;[noData]

The 
experiment was designed so that the binding of ID05 to 
wt-hPCSK9 masked surface residues normally exposed on 
wt-hPCSK9 not bound to the antibody.;[noData]

Such masked residues 
provided insight into the binding domain of I D05.;[noData]

Through 
such experiments, a novel neutralizing epitope conforma- 
tional in nature and represented by peptides RYRAD (SEQ ID 
NO: 42) AND REIEGR (SEQ ID NO: 37) was identified.;[noData]

This 
epitope falls within PCSK9's catalytic domain and provides a 
novel target epitope for which to identify additional effective 
PCSK9 antagonists.;[noData]

Identification of additional PCSK9-spe- 
cific antagonists binding this epitope is of significant interest 
given I D05's PCSK9-neutralizing activity.;[noData]

[0055] One means of identifying antagonists and particu- 
larly antibodies that bind to the identified I D05 epitope or an 
overlapping epitope is through a competition or similar assay 
where the candidate antibody or binding molecule would 
have to out-compete ID05 for the epitope.;[noData]

Competitive 
antagonists encompassed herein are molecules that inhibit 
(Le.;[noData]

, prevent or interfere with in comparison to a control) or 
reduce I D05 binding by at least 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% in 
order of increasing preference (even more preferably, at least 
90% and, most preferably, at least 95%) at I pM or less with 
ID05 at or below its K~, and in particular those molecules 
that antagonize (I) PCSK9 binding to the LDL receptor, (ii) 
PCSK9 internalization into cells, or (iii) both PCSK9 binding 
to the LDL receptor and PCSK9 internalization into cells.;[noData]

Competition between binding members may be readily 
assayed in vitro for example using ELISA and/or by moni- 
toring the interaction of the antibodies with PCSK9 in solu- 
tion.;[noData]

The exact means for conducting the analysis is not 
critical.;[noData]

PCSK9 may be immobilized to a 96-well plate or 
may be placed in a homogenous solution.;[noData]

In specific embodi- 
ments, the ability of unlabeled candidate antibody(ies) to 
block the binding of labeled ID05 can be measured using 
radioactive, enzyme or other labels.;[noData]

In the reverse assay, the 
ability of unlabeled antibodies to interfere with the interac- 
tion of labeled ID05 with PCSK9 wherein said ID05 and 
PCSK9 are already bound is determined.;[noData]

In specific embodi- 
ments, (I) PCSK9 is contacted with labeled ID05 (an anti- 
body molecule which comprises a VL comprising SEQ ID 
NO: 27 and a VH comprising SEQ ID NO: 11);;[noData]

(ii) PCSK9 is 
contacted with the candidate antibody or pool of antibodies;;[noData]

and (iii) antibodies capable of interrupting or preventing com- 
plexes between PCSK9 and I D05 are identified.;[noData]

The readout 
in such an example is through measurement of bound label.;[noData]

ID05 and the candidate antibody(ies) may be added in any 
order or at the same time.;[noData]

A specific assay that may be run is

that of Example 13 where the activity of an antibody found to 
bind to the same epitope domain as ID05 is illustrated.;[noData]

[0056] Antibodies identified as ID05 competitors in the 
above or other suitable assays may be tested for the ability to 
antagonize or neutralize (I) PCSK9 binding to the LDL recep- 
tor;;[noData]

and/or (ii) PCSK9 internalization into cells.;[noData]

These param- 
eters may be measured through the use of assays similar to 
that employed or described in the current specification.;[noData]

In 
specific embodiments, the inhibition demonstrated by the 
competing antibody is at least about 10% inhibition.;[noData]

In other 
embodiments, the inhibition is at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 
60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%.;[noData]

[0057] The present invention specifically encompasses 
PCSK9-specific antagonists and particularly monoclonal 
antibody molecules (and their corresponding amino acid and 
nucleic acid sequences) that selectively bind to the epitope 
identified for I D05 or an overlapping epitope interfering with 
I D05's binding to PCSK9.;[noData]

Critical residues for I D05 binding 
that were identified on the epitope of PCSK9 are those resi- 
dues corresponding to residues Arg194, Glu197 and Arg199 
of human PCSK9.;[noData]

The narrow epitope comprising these 
amino acid residues is represented by SEQ ID NO: 37 and 
falls within the area of SEQ ID NO: 39 of human PCSK9 and 
SEQ ID NO: 41 of murine PCSK9.;[noData]

A secondary footprint of 
the antibody is represented by SEQ ID NO: 42.;[noData]

Monoclonal 
antibodies that specifically bind to the conformational 
epitope represented by SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO:42 or 
an overlapping epitope antagonize or neutralize (I) PCSK9 
binding to the LDL receptor;;[37, 42]

(ii) PCSK9 internalization into 
cells, or (iii) both.;[noData]

Accordingly, monoclonal antibodies that

In specific embodiments of the present invention, the

or murine PCSK9 with a K~ of 1.;[noData]

2x10 M or less, and 
wherein the PCSK9-specific antagonist competes with I D05 
for binding to PCSK9.;[noData]

In specific embodiments hereof, the 
PCSK9-specific antagonists are further defined by one or 
more of the following qualities: they (I) reduce I D05 binding 
by at least 50% at I pM or less with I D05 at or below its K~,

This can (but need not) be 
accomplished through the use of labels on either or both 
molecules as will be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan.;[noData]

[0060] Peptides or peptidomimetics based on the regions 
corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 39 or SEQ ID NO: 41 (and in 
select embodiments the areas corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 
37 and SEQ ID NO: 42) should have antagonistic properties 
by preventing the interaction of PCSK9 with LDLR.;[noData]

Impor- 
tantly, peptides that comprise SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID 
NO: 42 should generate neutralizing antibodies able to inhibit 
PCSK9 binding to LDLR and/or inhibit PCSK9 internaliza- 
tion into cells.;[noData]

[0061] In specific embodiments, peptides encompassed 
herein comprise SEQ ID NO: 39 OR SEQ ID NO: 41.;[noData]

In 
select embodiments, the peptides comprise SEQ ID NO: 37 
and are less than 50 amino acids.;[noData]

In certain embodiments, the 
peptides comprise both SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 42 
and are 40 amino acids or less.;[noData]

In more specific embodiments, 
the peptides comprise SEQ ID NO: 37 and are less than 40 
amino acids, less than 30 amino acids, less than 20 amino 
acids, or less than 10 amino acids.;[noData]

[0062] Screening of peptides of the invention may be car- 
ried out utilizing competition assays as described above.;[noData]

If 
the peptide being tested competes with a ID05 antibody 
molecule (Le.;[noData]

any antibody molecule selective for PCSK9 
which comprises a VL comprising SEQ ID NO: 27 and a VH 
comprising SEQ ID NO: 11) as shown by a decrease in 
binding of such ID05 antibody molecule then it is likely that 
the peptide and ID05 bind to the same, or a closely related, 
epitope.;[noData]

Still another way to determine whether a peptide has 
the specificity of the ID05 antibody molecule is to pre-incu- 
bate the I D05 antibody molecule with PCSK9 with which it 
is normally reactive, and then add the peptide being tested 
with demonstrated specificity for PCSK9 to determine 
whether the peptide is inhibited in its ability to bind PCSK9.;[noData]

If the peptide being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, 
it has the same, or a functionally equivalent, epitope and 
specificity as the ID05 antibody molecule.;[noData]

[0063] Using routine procedures as outlined throughout the 
instant specification and well known to those of ordinary skill 
in the art, one can then determine whether a peptide which 
binds to PCSK9 is useful by determining whether the peptide 
is blocks PCSK9 from binding to the LDL receptor and/or 
prevents PCSK9 internalization into cells.;[noData]

VL regions in a full length antibody.;[noData]

Specific embodiments 
herein further comprise a series of amino acids selected from 
the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 21 (IgGI), SEQ ID NO: 
22 (IgG2), SEQ ID NO: 23 (IgG4) and SEQ ID NO: 24 (IgG2 
m4).;[noData]

[0086] Conservative amino acid substitutions, as one of 
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, are substitutions that 
replace an amino acid residue with one imparting similar or 
better (for the intended purpose) functional and/or chemical 
characteristics.;[noData]

Antagonists bearing such conservative amino 
acid substitutions can be tested for retained or better activity 
using functional assays available in the art or described 
herein.;[noData]

PCSK9-specific antagonists possessing one or more 
conservative amino acid substitutions which retain the ability 
to selectively bind to human PCSK9 and antagonize PCSK9 
functioning at a level the same or better than I D05 antibody 
molecules as described herein are referred to herein as "func- 
tional equivalents" of the disclosed antagonists and form 
specific embodiments of the present invention.;[noData]

Conservative 
amino acid substitutions are often ones in which the amino 
acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a 
similar side chain.;[noData]

Families of amino acid residues having 
similar side chains have been defined in the art.;[noData]

These fami- 
lies include amino acids with basic side chains (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, lysine, 
arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, aspartic acid, 
glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, glycine, 
asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, 
tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, alanine, valine, leu- 
cine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta- 
branched side chains (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, threonine, valine, isoleucine) and 
aromatic side chains (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryp- 
tophan, histidine).;[noData]

Such modifications are not designed to 
significantly reduce or alter the binding or functional inhibi- 
tion characteristics of the PCSK9-specific antagonist, albeit 
they may improve such properties.;[noData]

The purpose for making a 
substitution is not significant and can include, but is by no 
means limited to, replacing a residue with one better able to 
maintain or enhance the structure of the molecule, the charge 
or hydrophobicity o f the molecule, or the size of the molecule.;[noData]

For instance, one may desire simply to substitute a less 
desired residue with one of the same polarity or charge.;[noData]

Such 
modifications can be introduced by standard techniques 
known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR- 
mediated mutagenesis.;[noData]

One specific means by which those of 
skill in the art accomplish conservative amino acid substitu- 
tions is alanine scanning mutagenesis as discussed in, for 
example, MacLennan et al.;[noData]

[0087] In another aspect, the present invention provides 
isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific 
embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise heavy 
and/or light chain variable regions comprising amino acid 
sequences that are homologous to the corresponding amino 
acid sequences of the disclosed antibodies, wherein the anti- 
body molecules inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cel- 
lular LDL uptake.;[noData]

Specific embodiments are antagonists 
which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable regions 
which are at least 90'zo identical to disclosed heavy and/or 
light chain variable regions, respectively.;[noData]

Reference to "at 
least 90'zo identical" includes at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 
97, 98, 99 and 100'zo identical sequences along the full length 
of the molecule disclosed herein.;[noData]

[00SS] PCSK9-specific antagonists with amino acid 
sequences homologous to the amino acid sequences of 
antagonists described herein are typically produced to 
improve one or more of the properties of the antagonist with- 
out negatively impacting its specificity for PCSK9.;[noData]

One 
method of obtaining such sequences, which is not the only 
method available to the skilled artisan, is to mutate sequence 
encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist or specificity-deter- 
mining region(s) thereof, express an antagonist comprising 
the mutated sequence(s), and test the encoded antagonist for 
retained function using available functional assays including 
those described herein.;[noData]

Mutation may be by site-directed or 
random mutagenesis.;[noData]

As one of skill in the art will appreciate, 
however, other methods of mutagenesis can readily bring 
about the same effect.;[noData]

For example, in certain methods, the 
spectrum of mutants are constrained by non-randomly target- 
ing conservative substitutions based on either amino acid 
chemical or structural characteristics, or else by protein struc- 
tural considerations.;[noData]

In affinity maturation experiments, sev- 
eral such mutations may be found in a single selected mol- 
ecule, whether they are randomly or non-randomly selected.;[noData]

There are also various structure-based approaches toward 
affinity maturation as demonstrated in, e.;[noData]

BLAST protein searches are per- 
formed with the XBLAST program, score=50, 
wordlength=3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous 
to an amino acid sequence disclosed herein.;[noData]

To obtain gapped 
alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST is uti- 
lized as described in Altschul et al.;[noData]

When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST 
programs, the default parameters of the respective programs

[0090] Utilization of components of one or more disclosed 
PCSK9-specific molecules to produce other binding mol- 
ecules with similar or better specificity is well within the 
realm of one skilled in the art.;[noData]

This can be accomplished, for 
example, using techniques of recombinant DNA technology.;[noData]

"Human" in reference to 
the disclosed antibody molecules specifically refers to anti- 
body molecules having variable and/or constant regions 
derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences, 
wherein said sequences may, but need not, be modified/al- 
tered to have certain amino acid substitutions or residues that 
are not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin 
sequence.;[noData]

techniques.;[noData]

There are a plethora of mutation techniques in the 
scientific literature which are available to, and widely appre- 
ciated by, the skilled artisan.;[noData]

"Humanized" in reference to the 
disclosed antibody molecules refers specifically to antibody 
molecules wherein CDR sequences derived from another 
mammalian species, such as a mouse, are grafted onto human 
framework sequences.;[noData]

"Primatized" in reference to the dis-

[0094] Specific antibodies of the present invention are 
monoclonal antibodies and, in particular embodiments, are in 
one of the following antibody formats: IgD, IgA, IgE, IgM, 
IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 or any derivative of any of the fore- 
going.;[noData]

The language "derivatives 
thereof 
' or "derivatives" in 
this respect includes, inter alia, (I) antibodies and antibody 
molecules with conservative modifications in one or both 
variable regions (Le.;[noData]

, VH and/or VL), (ii) antibodies and 
antibody molecules with manipulations in the constant 
regions of the heavy and/or light chains, and/or (fii) antibod- 
ies and antibody molecules that contain additional chemical 
moieties which are not normally a part of the immunoglobulin 
molecule (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, pegylation).;[noData]

[0095] Manipulations of the variable regions can be within 
one or more of the VH and/or VL CDR regions.;[noData]

Site-directed 
mutagenesis, random mutagenesis or other method for gen- 
erating sequence or molecule diversity can be utilized to 
create mutants which can subsequently be tested for a par- 
ticular functional property of interest in available in vitro or in 
vivo assays including those described herein.;[noData]

[0096] Antibodies of the present invention also include 
those in which modifications have been made to the frame- 
work residues within VH and/or VL to improve one or more 
properties of the antibody of interest.;[noData]

Typically, such frame- 
work modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity 
of the antibody.;[noData]

For example, one approach is to "backmu- 
tate" one or more framework residues to the corresponding 
germline sequence.;[noData]

More specifically, an antibody that has 
undergone somatic mutation may contain framework resi- 
dues that differ from the germline sequence from which the 
antibody is derived.;[noData]

Such residues can be identified by com- 
paring the antibody framework sequences to the germline 
sequences from which the antibody is derived.;[noData]

Such "back- 
mutated" antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by 
the invention.;[noData]

Another type of framework modification 
involves mutating one or more residues within the framework 
region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T 
cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity 
of the antibody.;[noData]

This approach is also referred to as "deim- 
munization" and is described in further detail in U.;[noData]

within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies of the 
invention may be engineered to include modifications within 
the Fc or constant regions, where present, typically to alter 
one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as 
serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, 
and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.;[noData]

The present invention, therefore, 
encompasses antibodies in accordance with the present 
description that do not provoke (or provoke to a lesser extent) 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ("ADCC"), 
complement-mediated cytotoxicity ("CMC"), or form

that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment 
(s) within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked 
to the CL segment within the vector.;[noData]

Additionally or alterna- 
tively, the recombinant expression vector comprising nucleic 
acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist can encode a 
signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antagonist from 
a host cell.;[noData]

The nucleic acid can be cloned into the vector such 
that the nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide is linked in- 
frame adjacent to the PCSK9-specific antagonist-encoding 
nucleic acid.;[noData]

The signal peptide may be an immunoglobulin 
or a non-immunoglobulin signal peptide.;[noData]

Any technique 
available to the skilled artisan may be employed to introduce 
the nucleic acid into the host cell;;[noData]

ing, inhibiting, counteracting, neutralizing or curtailing one 
or more functions of PCSK9.;[noData]

Inhibition or antagonism of one 
or more of PCSK9-associated functional properties can be 
readily determined according to methodologies known to the 
art (see, e.;[noData]

and 
McNamara et al.;[noData]

as well as those described herein.;[noData]

Inhibition or antagonism 
will effectuate a decrease in PCSK9 activity relative to that 
seen in the absence of the antagonist or, for example, that seen 
when a control antagonist of irrelevant specificity is present.;[noData]

Preferably, a PCSK9-specific antagonist in accordance with 
the present invention antagonizes PCSK9 functioning to the 
point that there is a decrease of at least 10'zo, of the measured 
parameter including but not limited to the activities disclosed 
herein, and more preferably, a decrease of at least 20 lo, 30 lo, 
40 lo, 50 lo, 60 lo, 70lo, 80 lo, 90 lo and 95 lo of the measured 
parameter.;[noData]

Such inhibition/antagonism of PCSK9 function- 
ing is particularly effective in those instances where PCSK9 
functioning is contributing at least in part to a particular 
phenotype, disease, disorder or condition which is negatively 
impacting the subject.;[noData]

ments of the present invention include such methods wherein 
the cell is a human cell.;[noData]

Additional embodiments of the 
present invention include such methods wherein the cell is a 
murine cell.;[noData]

[0120] In another aspect, the present invention provides a 
method for antagonizing the activity of PCSK9 in a subject, 
which comprises administering to the subject a therapeuti- 
cally effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the 
present invention.;[noData]

In specific embodiments, the methods for 
antagonizing PCSK9 function are for the treatment of a 
PCSK9-associated disease, disorder or condition or, alterna- 
tively, a disease, disorder or condition that could benefit from 
the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist.;[noData]

The medicament would be 
useful in a subject(s) exhibiting a condition associated with 
PCSK9 activity, or a condition where the functioning of 
PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject.;[noData]

In select 
embodiments, the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, 
coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary 
syndrome or related conditions.;[noData]

[0121] The present invention, thus, contemplates the use of 
PCSK9-specific antagonists described herein in various 
methods of treatment where antagonizing PCSK9 function is 
desirable.;[noData]

The method of treatment can be prophylactic or 
therapeutic in nature.;[noData]

In specific embodiments, the present 
invention relates to a method of treatment for a condition 
associated with/attributed to PCSK9 activity, or a condition 
where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a 
particular subject, which comprises administering to the sub- 
ject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific 
antagonist of the present invention.;[noData]

In select embodiments, 
the condition may be hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart 
disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or 
related conditions.;[noData]

[0122] Methods of treatment in accordance with the present 
invention comprise administering to an individual a therapeu- 
tically (or prophylactically) effective amount of a PCSK9- 
specific antagonist of the present invention.;[noData]

Use of the terms 
"therapeutically effective" or "prophylactically effective" in 
reference to an amount refers to the amount necessary at the 
intended dosage to achieve the desired therapeutic/prophy- 
lactic effect for the period of time desired.;[noData]

The desired effect 
may be, for example, amelioration of at least one symptom 
associated with the treated condition.;[noData]

These amounts will 
vary, as the skilled artisan will appreciate, according to vari- 
ous factors, including but not limited to the disease state, age, 
sex and weight of the individual, and the ability of the 
PCSK9-specific antagonist to elicit the desired effect in the 
individual.;[noData]

The response may be documented by in vitro 
assay, in vivo non-human animal studies, and/or further sup- 
ported from clinical trials.;[noData]

[0123] The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be adminis- 
tered as a pharmaceutical composition.;[noData]

The present inven-

tion comprising a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention 
and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier including but not 
limited to an excipient, diluent, stabilizer, buffer, or alterna-

"Stable" as used herein refers to the property of the protein or 
PCSK9-specific antagonist to retain its physical or chemical 
stability, conformational integrity, or its ability to exhibit less 
denaturation, protein clipping, aggregation, fragmentation, 
acidic variant formation or loss of biological activity com- 
pared with a control sample at a temperature in the range of 
4-37' C.;[noData]

for at least about 30 days.;[noData]

Other embodiments 
remain stable for up to 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 
years or longer periods at the above temperatures.;[noData]

In specific 
embodiments the formulation exhibits no significant changes 
at 2-8' C.;[noData]

for at least 6 months, and preferably 12 months, 2 
years or longer, in order of preference.;[noData]

Specific embodiments 
experience less than 10'zo or, in particular embodiments, less 
than 5'zo of denaturation, protein clipping, aggregation, frag- 
mentation, acidic variant formation or loss ofbiological activ- 
ity compared with a control sample at a temperature in the 
range of 25-45' C.;[noData]

(or alternatively 2-8' C.;[noData]

) for at least about 
30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years or longer.;[noData]

Stability of the formulations can be tested via several means 
known to the skilled artisan including, but not limited to Size 
Exclusion Chromatography (SEC-HPLC) to measure aggre- 
gation and fragmentation, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) 
to measure particle size of concentrated samples, capillary 
SDS-PAGE to measure fragmentation and capillary iso-elec- 
tric focusing (cIEF) or cation exchange chromatography 
("CEX") to measure acidic variants formation.;[noData]

There are various techniques available to the 
skilled artisan to accomplish this including, but not limited to, 
filtration through sterile filtration membranes.;[noData]

In specific 
embodiments, employing lyophilized and reconstituted com- 
positions, this may be done prior to or following lyophiliza-

A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can 
readily determine and prescribe the effective therapeutic 
amount of the antagonist.;[noData]

Dosage ranges may be from about 
0.;[noData]

01 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.;[noData]

05 to 25 mg/kg, of the 
host body weight.;[noData]

For example, dosages can be 03 mg/kg 
body weight, I mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 
mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the 
range of 1-10 mg/kg.;[noData]

For purposes of illustration, and not 
limitation, in specific embodiments, a dose of 5 mg to 2.;[noData]

0 g 
may be utilized to deliver the antagonist systemically.;[noData]

Opti- 
mal precision in achieving concentrations of antagonist 
within a range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a 
regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to the 
target site(s).;[noData]

This involves a consideration of the distribution, 
equilibrium, and elimination of the PCSK9-specific antago- 
nist.;[noData]

Antagonists described herein may be used alone at 
appropriate dosages.;[noData]

Alternatively, co-administration or 
sequential administration of other agents may be desirable.;[noData]

It 
will be possible to present a therapeutic dosing regime for the 
PCSK9-specific antagonists of the present invention in con- 
junction with alternative treatment regimes.;[noData]

For example, 
PCS K9-specific antagonists may be used in combination or in 
conjunction with other drugs (therapeutic and/or prophylac- 
tic), including but not limited to cholesterol-lowering drugs, 
for example, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, Zetia) 
and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, Zocor and 
Vytorln).;[noData]

The present invention contemplates such combi- 
nations and they form an important embodiment hereof.;[noData]

Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods of treat- 
ment as described above where the PCSK9-specific antago- 
nist is administered/delivered simultaneously with, following 
or prior to another drug or drugs (therapeutic and/or prophy- 
lactic), including but not limited to cholesterol-lowering 
drugs, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and cholesterol 
absorption inhibitors.;[noData]

[0139] Individuals (subjects) capable of treatment as 
described herein include primates, human and non-human, 
and include any non-human mammal or vertebrate of com- 
mercial or domestic veterinary importance.;[noData]

[0140] The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be adminis- 
tered to an individual by any route of administration appre- 
ciated in the art, including but not limited to oral administra- 
tion, administration by injection (specific embodiments of 
which include intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or 
intramuscular injection), administration by inhalation, intra- 
nasal, or topical administration, either alone or in combina- 
tion with other agents designed to assist in the treatment of the 
individual.;[noData]

The PCSK9-specific antagonist may also be 
administered by injection devices, injector pens, needleless 
devices;;[noData]

and subcutaneous patch delivery systems.;[noData]

The route 
of administration should be determined based on a number of 
considerations appreciated by the skilled artisan including, 
but not limited to, the desired physiochemical characteristics 
of the treatment.;[noData]

Treatment may be provided on a daily, 
weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, or any other regimen that 
delivers the appropriate amount of PCSK9-specific antago- 
nist to the individual at the prescribed times such that the 
desired treatment is effected and maintained.;[noData]

The formula- 
tions may be administered in a single dose or in more than one 
dose at separate times.;[noData]

[0141] Also contemplated are methods of using the dis- 
closed antagonists in the manufacture of a medicament for 
treatment of a PCSK9-associated disease, disorder or condi- 
tion or, alternatively, a disease, disorder or condition that 
could benefit from the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist.;[noData]

The 
medicament would be useful in a subject(s) exhibiting a con- 
dition associated with PCSK9 activity, or a condition where 
the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular 
subject.;[noData]

In select embodiments, the condition may be hyper- 
cholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syn- 
drome, acute coronary syndrome or related conditions.;[noData]

[0142] PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed herein may 
also be used as a method of diagnosis of PCSK9.;[noData]

In select 
embodiments, the present invention encompasses methods of 
identifying or quantifying the level of PCSK9 present in a 
sample (including but not limited to a biological sample, e.;[noData]

g.;[noData]

, 
serum or blood) which comprises contacting the sample with 
a PCSK9-specific antagonist described herein and detecting 
or quantifying, respectively, binding to PCSK9.;[noData]

The PCSK9- 
specific antagonist may be used in various assay formats 
known to the skilled artisan and may form part of a kit (the 
general features of a kit of which are further described below).;[noData]

[0143] The present invention further provides for the 
administration of disclosed anti-PCSK9 antagonists for pur- 
poses of gene therapy.;[noData]

Through such methods, cells of a 
subject are trans formed with nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9- 
specific antagonist of the invention.;[noData]

Subjects comprising the 
nucleic acids then produce the PCSK9-specific antagonists 
endogenously.;[noData]

Previously, Alvarez, et al, Clinical Cancer 
Research 6:3081-3087, 2000, introduced single-chain anti- 
ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach.;[noData]

The methods disclosed by Alvarez, et al, supra, may be easily 
adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an 
anti-PCSK9 antibody of the invention to a subject.;[noData]

[0144] Nucleic acids encoding any PCSK9-specific 
antagonist may be introduced to a subject.;[noData]

[0145] The nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of 
a subject by any means known in the art.;[noData]

In preferred embodi- 
ments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral 
vector.;[noData]

Examples of preferred viruses from which the vectors 
may be derived include lentiviruses, herpes viruses, adenovi- 
ruses, adeno-associated viruses, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, 
alphavirus, influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses 
with desirable cellular tropism.;[noData]

[0147] Methods for constructing and using viral vectors are 
known in the art (see, e g.;[noData]

, Miller, et al, Bio Techniques 7: 980- 
990, 1992).;[noData]

Preferably, the viral vectors are replication defec- 
tive, that is, they are unable to replicate autonomously, and 
thus are not infectious, in the target cell.;[noData]

Preferably, the rep- 
lication defective virus is a minimal virus, i.;[noData]

e.;[noData]

, it retains only 
the sequences of its genome which are necessary for encapsi- 
dating the genome to produce viral particles.;[noData]

Defective 
viruses, which entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes, are 
preferred.;[noData]

Use of defective viral vectors allows for adminis-
